			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781538765494">Parable of the Sower</a> by Octavia E. Butler üìö</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It feels remarkably relevant (even down to the years this story is set in!) to our current political and climate situation. Despite how tough and awful the world described here is, there‚Äôs a message of hope.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm excited to immediately move on to <em>Parable of the Talents</em>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the presentation, he showed off the Dock. You all know the Dock, it‚Äôs been at the bottom of your Mac screen for what feels like forever (if you keep it in the correct location, anyway).
I should know ‚Äì I had spent the previous 18 months or so as the main engineer working away on it. At that very moment, I was watching from a cubicle in Apple Cork, in Ireland. For the second time in my short Apple career, I said a quiet prayer to the gods of demos, hoping that things didn‚Äôt break. For context, I was in my twenties at this point and scared witless.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hello and welcome to another travel report, this time on our short trip to the area around Apalachicola in Florida&rsquo;s panhandle with my wife and our two dogs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been to Florida, you may have noticed that they like to give catchy names to their numerous coasts. Here is no different and is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Florida&rsquo;s forgotten coast.&rdquo; Sounds ominous, but in fact we found it beautiful and had a wonderful time. But it does live up to this name, at least in our experience during this trip: the crowds forgot to come! Typically, winter is the peak season for Florida, but we were pretty shocked to find that&rsquo;s not the case here, at least not this particular week in December. We had the beach to ourselves, and a few restaurants!</p>
<p>We stayed about 25 minutes from Apalachicola at a location known as Indian Pass Beach which is a tiny peninsula adjacent to St. Vincent Island.</p>
<p>Our first full day there was a bit cloudy, but it was still fairly warm and made for a nice walk on the beach with the dogs.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0670.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A dog is lying on a deserted beach under a cloudy sky."></p>
<p>Lunch was at <a href="https://indianpassrawbar.com">Indian Pass Raw Bar</a> where we had our first taste of the famous Apalachicola oyster. Here we had them raw and in a preparation they simply call baked, which is oysters on the half shell sprinkled with cheese and baked until brown. Both were great! I also really liked the steamed shrimp here.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0738.jpeg" alt="Auto-generated description: A tray holds several opened oysters with a small cup of sauce on the side."></p>
<p>Interestingly, ahead of the trip we learned about the harvesting of the wild oysters from Apalachicola Bay, or more accurately the lack thereof. The Bay has been closed for oyster harvesting since 2020 in order to allow the wild oysters and ecosystem time to recover after the BP oil spill and other recent negative impacts. Next year is the end of the initial prohibition, but it&rsquo;s unclear if the Bay will be reopened for harvesting so soon. So, where do all the local oysters come from in restaurants? Well, oyster farming is still allowed and I believe that makes up the local supply. Supposedly these farms are actually helping the ecosystem recover, as oysters tend to act like filters that help to remove impurities from the water. I do hope the Bay is given enough time to completely recover before wild harvesting resumes.</p>
<p>After lunch, we headed to the <a href="https://www.visitgulf.com/listing/forgotten-coast-sea-turtle-center/245/">Forgotten Coast Sea Turtle Center</a> and got tour by one of the volunteers. This center exists to help support the sea turtle population that nests on the beaches in the area. They are also acting as a sanctuary to a few (non-sea) turtles and tortoises which were mostly donated pets. Excitingly, we were able to sponsor a nest for the 2025 sea turtle season, which means we funded protective measures to be placed when a nest is discovered on the beach. Then, we&rsquo;ll get some info about the location of the nest and how it progresses throughout the incubation period. We might return next year to check on our nest! (Sorry, somehow forgot to take any photos at the Center!)</p>
<p>It was nearing dinner time and we had learned that with the reduced crowds, it was best to get in early before restaurants closed. Our destination this evening: Hole in the Wall Seafood in Apalachicola.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0740.jpeg" alt="Auto-generated description: A display of numerous hats on a wall is accompanied by a vintage-style poster and a shelf filled with small items."></p>
<p>Here, of course, we had more raw oysters! I also tried the seafood gumbo which was good and piping hot.</p>

<p>The next day, we decided to head over to St. George Island State Park with the dogs. But first, a stop at Bayside Coffee.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0696.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A black and white photo depicts a sign for Bayside Coffee Co. next to a roadside with parked vehicles and trees in the background."></p>
<p>When we arrived at the State Park, we learned dogs were not allowed on the beach. But that was fine, since it was pretty foggy and we wanted to explore other parts of the park.</p>

<p>We decided to walk on a trail through the salt marsh, which ended up being beautiful in the fog.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0730.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A foggy landscape features a dense forest of tall, leafless trees and overgrown grass."></p>
<p>On the way back through Apalachicola, we stopped for lunch at Up The Creek Raw Bar which is right beside the docks along the river.</p>

<p>That afternoon, we rode bikes along the beach outside where we were staying. It was a surreal experience with the fog, the waves breaking right next to us, and the mostly empty beaches. We saw  more dolphins than people!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0757.jpeg" alt="Auto-generated description: Two bicycles are parked on a sandy beach near the ocean on a foggy day."></p>
<p>That night, we returned to Apalachicola for dinner at Owl Cafe which was located in a really cool old building.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/4f3f2299-2b67-4e3c-b9e4-8bdea21e4edf.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A two-story building features the OWL CAFE sign, with ivy climbing its facade and a warmly lit entrance at night."></p>
<p>Of course, we had more oysters here! The rest of the food was good too with the gumbo being the highlight of the meal for me.</p>
<p>After dinner, we took the dogs for their evening walk before the moon rose and when we looked out at the waves breaking into the beach we thought our eyes were playing tricks on us. It looked like the waves were glowing as they broke. But as we watched in awe we realized it must be bioluminescence that was triggered by the motion of the waves! It was unexpected and incredible! There was so little light pollution that we could see this naturally occurring phenomenon. I&rsquo;ve only witnessed bioluminescent waters in one other place: the bio bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico. While I know that the dinoflagellates that produce the light are common in ocean water, I thought it was exceptionally rare that they are present in enough concentration for humans to see their light. So I was very shocked that they appeared to us on this nighttime walk! After a little research, I learned it can be more common than I realized in the Gulf waters. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t have the necessary equipment to photograph the effect (namely, a tripod).</p>
<p>The next morning we had time for one last walk along the beach before our departure.</p>

<p>Browsing the internet used to be a hobby of mine. Ever since my dad got us a modem when I was around ten, I spent hours at a time just looking at different websites. The internet felt like a limitless expanse of free expression.

The goal of this project is to challenge myself to showcase the locations, scenes, and objects that I see every day. I&rsquo;m hoping this will be a fun way to practice photography. I&rsquo;ll also be posting these as a <a href="https://glass.photo/doug-jones/series/1VMJiJ6Jy8CRfDmx6gxZlY-everyday">series on Glass</a> if you&rsquo;d like to follow along there.

			 <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenmue">Shenmue</a> is one of the first games that I&rsquo;m revisiting on my <a href="https://doug.pub/2024/11/05/the-dreamcast-is.html">Dreamcast</a>. Originally released in 1999, Shenmue is an open-world RPG/life simulation set in 1980s Japan. It was the most expensive game ever developed at the time and I think it shows.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I originally played Shenmue, I remember being blown away by the level of detail and that every NPC has voiced dialogue (the English voice actors weren&rsquo;t great&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t think I cared much at the time). The world has a realistic day/night cycle and people and shops follow realistic patterns. Sometimes, you&rsquo;ll need to enter a shop or restaurant and it doesn&rsquo;t open until a certain time, but unlike a lot of modern games you can&rsquo;t enter a menu and pass the time. Instead, you must wait or kill time in game. Thankfully one of the early areas has an arcade where you can spend in-game money to play classic Sega games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Harrier">Space Harrier</a> (which was also developed by Shenmue&rsquo;s designer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Suzuki">Yu Suzuki</a>).</p>
<p>Playing Shenmue today, I think the graphics and game design holds up fairly well. But it&rsquo;s definitely a different approach to games of this type. The pace is slow. You have no choice but to be patient at times. There&rsquo;s also no map in the menus or HUD. Instead, you must find maps in the game world and figure out how to navigate from that. The controls feel a bit awkward, for some reason forcing you to use the d-pad for movement while the analog stick serves as a sort of first person view camera movement input.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several more modern ways to play Shenmue, but I&rsquo;m happy that I can revisit the original on real hardware. And with the mods installed in my DC, it looks better than it ever did in 1999!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m now the proud owner of the Sega Dreamcast&hellip;again! I was lucky enough to get one on launch day 25 years ago on 9/9/99. And now, I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s time to own one again.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cd9bdb7b-3b61-4e79-9232-229f4a6a106b.jpg" alt="A Sega Dreamcast console and its controller on a dark surface. The console is white with the Dreamcast logo, and the controller features a joystick, a D-pad, and four colored buttons."></p>
<p>However, this console has been modded in several important ways. First, it has a HDMI port added. This taps directly into the GPU&rsquo;s output allowing for 1080p display. Second, the disk drive has been swapped with a SD card reader. This allows you to play backups and should be much more reliable going forward than a spinning disk drive.</p>
<p>It arrived just in time to serve as a perfect distraction!</p>

<p>A game of Rez anyone? Looks fantastic on my OLED tv, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to replaying Shenmue and old Resident Evil games.</p>

<p>I think and talk a lot about the risks of powerful AI. The company I‚Äôm the CEO of, Anthropic, does a lot of research on how to reduce these risks. Because of this, people sometimes draw the conclusion that I‚Äôm a pessimist or ‚Äúdoomer‚Äù who thinks AI will be mostly bad or dangerous. I don‚Äôt think that at all. In fact, one of my main reasons for focusing on risks is that they‚Äôre the only thing standing between us and what I see as a fundamentally positive future. [&hellip;]
In this essay I try to sketch out what that upside might look like&ndash;what a world with powerful AI might look like if everything goes <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>I read a wonderful twitter thead about CGI and the birth of the web and this triggered a thought I&rsquo;ve been kicking around.
&ldquo;Wasm is the new CGI&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good article. Web server technology is an area of interest for me, and I think the author is right: Wasm is positioned to be the next big thing in this space. I think it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before the tooling and platforms are mature enough for wide adoption.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t miss the <a href="https://x.com/progrium/status/1337074333018189824">Twitter thread about CGI and the birth of the web</a>. This was a great walk through history. As someone who&rsquo;s been working in this space for a long time, it was so fun to see this look back at the history and the impact this technology had. I basically owe my career to CGI!</p>

<p>A look at Mozilla‚Äôs rebrand. ‚ÄúMozilla‚Äôs new logo is a flag symbol built from the Mozilla M that comes to life to reveal the company‚Äôs iconic Tyrannosaurus Rex symbol and mascot, originally designed by Shepard Fairey.‚Äù</p>

<p>I like it, especially that it incorporates the T-Rex. Not so sure I believe Mozilla will live up to the brand that&rsquo;s described here&hellip;but I&rsquo;d like to be wrong about this. Here&rsquo;s hoping they live up to their mission.</p>

<p>I got to take home the console and Sonic Adventure, but no memory cards were available. So, that first night I kept the console running with the TV off all night long so I could keep my progress after school the next day.</p>
<p>The rental period, whatever it was (probably not more than a few days or week) went by in a flash. I was left feeling super hyped for 9/9/99.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a console releasing like this today?</p>

When you write it out like this, sounds like Stephenson is jumping on every modern tech bandwagon. But, they seem to have a shared interest in helping to create a more open Metaverse platform and tooling, so maybe there will eventually be something of substance there.</p>

<p>During XOXO, Andy Baio said ‚ÄúEvery one of you should have a home on the web not controlled by a billionaire.‚Äù Cabel Sasser recommended that we all ‚Äúput up the dang portfolio.‚Äù Molly White asked us to think back to ‚Äúwhen was the first time you thought the web was magic?‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned that I‚Äôve been feeling this a lot over the last few years, even as I too am witnessing what many of us think about as ‚Äúthe web‚Äù rotting right in front of our eyes. Working outside of that rot pile, and perhaps motivated by it, there are so many people who are excited about the potential for a better web.</p>

<p>Thanks to Craig Mod for coming all the way from Japan to share the stage with me for a too-brief chat about membership programs. In the run-up to this, Craig and I had three extensive conversations about memberships, the open web, the value of writing your own software, Walt Disney‚Äôs corporate strategy chart, and many more things.</p>

<p>Reading these posts, I got a dose of second hand excitement about the open web and the energy to continue to build it into the thing we all want.</p>

			 <p>Manu Moreale <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/fighting-bots">writes about fighting AI bots</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess there are only two options left:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because that&rsquo;s just the world we live in</li>
<li>Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our content</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And Molly White <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro/entry/fighting-bots-is-fighting-humans">responds</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One advantage to working on freely-licensed projects for over a decade is that I was forced to grapple with this decision far before mass scraping for AI training.</p>
<p>In my personal view, option 1 is almost strictly better. Option 2 is never as simple as &ldquo;only allow actual human beings access&rdquo; because <a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/is-acceptably-non-dystopian-self-sovereign-identity-even-possible/#proof-of-personhood">determining who&rsquo;s a human is <em>hard</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Molly&rsquo;s perspective really resonates with me. I like the comparison to open source software, where a freely licensed project could always be used by companies in for-profit products. However, what&rsquo;s missing from the open web is some standards around licensing with regard to AI models. Just because something is free to read, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s free to use in any way, including ingestion into an LLM.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering, what if there was something like the GPL, but for text and images used as training data? This might work something like: it&rsquo;s ok to use my content to train your model, as long as the model you produce is freely shared back with the public. It&rsquo;s not ok to train on my content if your model remains private.</p>
<p>Of course, there are content producers who would not be ok with their data included in any sort of AI training, and that&rsquo;s totally fine. It&rsquo;s their work, they can decide how to license it. What&rsquo;s missing is a standard way for them to declare this (and for LLM builders to respect that).</p>
<p>The other aspect of Molly&rsquo;s post that resonated with me is trying to fight bots while letting all the humans view your content. In my last job, I worked for a few years on our &ldquo;traffic&rdquo; team, which was responsible for, among other things, some technology to block bots and other crawlers. We ran these systems this for things we found abusive (like DDoS&rsquo;s or bots that put too much load on our servers), rather than trying to limit access to just humans. But, the fundamental problem is shared: trying to separate legit traffic from stuff that should be blocked. It&rsquo;s really not easy to do this, especially if you consider some non-human traffic important. (Like Google&rsquo;s crawler!) So, you&rsquo;ll most likely want to err on the side of letting things through, if you aren&rsquo;t absolutely sure it&rsquo;s something you want to block. Which means that any AI crawler that isn&rsquo;t playing nicely (respecting robots.txt, providing a clear user-agent, etc.) will probably slip through your defenses anyway.</p>

<p>Some will tell you that Mozilla&rsquo;s worst decision was to accept funding from Google, and that may have been the first domino, but I hold that implementing DRM is what doomed them, as it led to their culture of capitulation. It demonstrated that their decisions were the decisions of a company shipping products, not those of a non-profit devoted to preserving the open web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sad to see Mozilla&rsquo;s decline. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder, which browser is left carrying the torch of the open web?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Safari more, as I feel it&rsquo;s most aligned with my interests and tastes these days. But I&rsquo;m not sure Apple is the best steward of the open web, since this platform tends to compete with their App Store platform.</p>
<p>So, who&rsquo;s left? Certainly not Google and Chrome.</p>

		<a href="https://doug.pub/2024/06/18/travel-report-italy.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-18 09:52:15 -0500">Jun 18, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hello from Delta flight 67 Rome to Atlanta!</p>
<p>Now that our time in Italy has wrapped up, I thought I&rsquo;d try to compile some thoughts on our overall experience in Italy. This was my first time traveling in Italy. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to visit for some time since I love Italian food and I have some heritage in Italy via my mother&rsquo;s side of the family (according to my DNA report, I&rsquo;m just under 25% genetically Italian heritage). And, for various reasons, the Italian culture is the one that has prevailed in my family&rsquo;s traditions. So, the trip was more meaningful to me than most.</p>
<p>In short, our time in Italy was fantastic! The food and scenery both exceeded my expectations. The food especially just seems so much better than what we have access to in the US. Even simple, raw ingredients, like a tomato, tasted much better than anything I&rsquo;ve had before. And for more complex ingredients like olive oil and cheese, well, Italy is just producing stuff on another level compared to America. I&rsquo;m definitely returning home feeling inspired to do what I can to find local, fresh ingredients for meals at home.</p>
<p>One experience that is really sticking with me is making pasta in our airbnb. The host provided the ingredients and suggested a simple preparation of just olive oil and cheese crumbled on top, which is what we did. We simply cooked the orecchiette in salted water, topped it with olive oil, salt, and crumbled cheese. We added fresh tomatoes as garnish. This dish was fantastic! And it took all of 15 minutes to prepare. I&rsquo;ve cooked a lot of pasta at home in the US and I&rsquo;ve never had something be so easy and incredibly delicious. There was no skill on our part, so the only explanation is really great ingredients.</p>
<p>Looking back to the places we visited, in order: Rome, Florence, Tuscany, Puglia. I don&rsquo;t think I can pick a favorite. In fact, I think a highlight was visiting multiple regions and seeing the differences in food and culture. We learned about Italian history and how most cities (and the regions around them) were distinct with their own cultures and dialects until Italian unification in 1861. Even to this day, these regional differences carry on. We learned of a few different dialects and how different they are from one another. So, if you visit Italy, I&rsquo;d definitely suggest visiting a few regions to experience these differences.</p>
<p>In Rome, we loved seeing the ancient Roman history in the Colosseum and Imperial Forum. It&rsquo;s amazing to have a view onto this ancient civilization and see the city they built. It&rsquo;s also incredible to think that Rome has been inhabited continuously since antiquity. We also enjoyed modern Rome, meaning it&rsquo;s a vibrant city beyond the touristy parts. This means you can find authentic, local food without too much trouble. Some of our favorite dishes were in Rome.</p>
<p>Florence was amazing to see the art and the beautiful Renaissance era buildings and streets. If you stay in the central part of the city, it&rsquo;s very walkable. Florence is also very touristy, every street is filled with tourists. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, but is the reality of visiting the historic parts of Florence. The food can be great here too, we had one of the best meals of our trip here. So, it&rsquo;s certainly possible to avoid tourist traps and find great places.</p>
<p>Tuscany was beautiful. Just driving through the countryside, or even better, biking through it, gives you so many scenic views. I enjoyed that we got to stay at a farmhouse and enjoy some agritourism while we were there. Visiting all the small Tuscany towns was very fun too, each one has its own unique history and feel to it. Of course, the food is great in Tuscany. We loved the handmade pici pasta, and had one of the best cacio e pepe dishes of our trip in Tuscany. The wine is great here too, and it was fun to visit a few vineyards and see exactly where the grapes came from.</p>
<p>Finally, our time in Puglia was great as well. While both Puglia and Tuscany are heavily into agriculture, I think Puglia exceeds Tuscany in this regard, giving you access to fresh, local foods almost everywhere you go. In fact, many of the foods we had in Puglia were the best on our trip. We loved the bread (especially the focaccia), cheese, meats, and seafood here. Puglia is also a lot less touristy than Tuscany, especially if you get away from the coast and head inland. Our e-bike tour through Puglia was one of the best rides of my life. The Pugliese countryside is beautiful in its own, unique way. I also loved the cities rendered in white, from the cobblestone streets to the buildings. Puglia definitely felt as if it could have been a different country from Tuscany and the cities of Rome and Florence.</p>
<p>So, overall the trip was great! I&rsquo;m already thinking about when we might be able to return to Italy. I&rsquo;m definitely going to miss the great food (and lack of humidity) after returning home!</p>

			 <p>Hello from Puglia, aboard the train headed to Rome. Puglia was the last leg of our trip in Italy, aside from tonight in Rome before we catch our flight back to Atlanta tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s cover what we got into in Puglia!</p>
<p>We stayed in a house just outside the city of Noci. It was a great property with beautiful gardens. It really felt like we were deep in the countryside even though we were a kilometer or two from town.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where we stayed.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/25d0ff9a-4995-4e87-b8b2-55d0eea22e77.jpg" alt="A rustic stone house surrounded by trees and greenery. There is a small patio area with a metal table and chairs on the right. The ground is covered in gravel and there is an old wooden door on the house. The sky is partly cloudy."></p>
<p>On our first full day, the main event was an e-bike tour around the Pugliese countryside. We started in Alberobello which is known for buildings with conical stacked stone roofs known as trulli. In fact, you can find these buildings all over Puglia, but they are concentrated in Alberobello, and some have been converted into shops and hotels.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/885df7dc-7e3d-4c46-94b3-6f3fb2e3a004.jpg" alt="This image shows a narrow street lined with traditional whitewashed stone houses featuring conical roofs, known as trulli, under a clear blue sky. The houses have small flower pots placed along the sidewalk. The overall scene is bright and tranquil."></p>
<p>We spent some time here, seeing the trulli up close and we even were able to enter one. These buildings are often 100s of years old and very rustic. Living in them can be a hard life, since you don&rsquo;t have many modern comforts. We learned that for this reason, maybe 20-30 years ago, most people were trying to get out of Alberobello to live somewhere more modern. It wasn&rsquo;t until relatively recently that it became more of a tourist attraction and owning a trulli became more desirable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bc352d03-3f0a-4b50-ad01-7079de1c8111.jpg" alt="A close-up view of a traditional trullo house with whitewashed stone walls and a conical roof made of stone slabs. The house features a chimney and an arched entrance covered with a curtain. "></p>

<p>Us with our guide, Adriano, who was fantastic!</p>

One person is wearing a bike helmet, another has a colorful cap, and the third is wearing sunglasses. The background shows a picturesque landscape. "></p>
<p>Our next stop was Martina Franca, where we stopped for a coffee break in this plaza. We drank caff√® Lecce, which is espresso over ice with sweet almond syrup (more on this later). I&rsquo;m glad we were introduced to this drink, because it&rsquo;s great! Especially on a hot day.</p>

The foreground features a smiling cyclist in a blue and white jersey with red-tinted sunglasses, taking a selfie. Two other cyclists can be seen in the background wearing helmets."></p>
<p>Locorotondo was the next stop.</p>

The image features cloudy skies, green vineyards, farmland, and scattered buildings surrounded by vegetation. A sign reading &ldquo;SIROSE&rdquo; is visible near the bottom of the stairs."></p>
<p>Here we had a &ldquo;light&rdquo; lunch featuring some typical Pugliese foods, such as cappicola, focaccia, bruschetta, burrata, and orecchiette. Everything was extremely delicious! I especially loved the focaccia we had in Puglia. Often it was made with a darker grain that gave it more flavor. I think the focaccia here is the best I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>

<p>Our ride completed by circling back to Alberobello. I recorded our route on <a href="https://strava.app.link/u5oBWkt7uKb">Strava</a> if you are curious for more detail. At 50 kilometers, it was a long ride, but very fun! One of the best rides of my life!</p>

<p>That night for dinner, we headed into Noci.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/8df59233-7d25-4883-bdff-cf1dab14e342.jpg" alt="This image features a street view of a picturesque European town during dusk. The focal point is a tall, red clock tower with a white clock face and a dome roof. The tower is flanked by whitewashed buildings with green shutters and balconies. "></p>
<p>The next day, we drove south to head to tour a dairy farm that specializes in cheese.</p>
<p>One of the pens where cows are kept. We learned how the different pens are used to group cows that are different stages of their milk production cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1bad3d58-8b13-4f0b-8b42-0bd851b75c7c.jpg" alt="A livestock farm with a dirt-covered ground, a large manure pile, and several weathered concrete structures. Two pigeons are perched on one of the structures. The sky is partly cloudy."></p>
<p>Some of their cows resting in the shade.</p>

Hay is scattered on the ground, and there is an open view of fields and trees in the background."></p>
<p>Then, we got to tour the cheese laboratory, as they called it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5ec1c195-d6c4-4792-b693-79b8e68036b6.jpg" alt="Two people are in a cheese-making facility. One person, wearing a hairnet, suspenders, and shoe covers, looks at their phone. The other person, dressed in white protective clothing, including a hat, apron, and boots, holds cheese. "></p>
<p>Hoping I got &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; locked in the cheese aging room.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ee414087-adc9-4c7e-ad4a-400920f5ec66.jpg" alt="A storage room filled with shelves and racks holding various types and shapes of cheese. On the left, multiple rows of round, wheel-shaped cheeses are stacked on wooden shelves. On the right, round cheeses with a bulbous shape are hanging from metal racks. "></p>
<p>Then, the highlight of the tour, watching one of the cheesemakers demonstrate how to make fresh mozzarella. He explained that you only need 3 things for cheese: milk, salt, and enzymes.</p>
<p>For this demonstration, he started with fresh cheese curds and added salt and hot water then began to mix and stretch it with a wooden pallet.</p>
<p>Here the curds are being stirred with the added salt and water.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/90821506-4769-46f5-b0b2-c9b4ae5cc333.jpg" alt="A group of people wearing hairnets and protective shoe covers are observing a cheesemaker demonstrate cheese-making. The cheesemaker, wearing a white uniform and hat, is stirring curds in a wooden bucket on a metal table."></p>
<p>Now the curds are starting to come together and are being stretched further.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f8ffb20f-fa84-48d2-85e5-a9fa19160cf8.jpg" alt="A group of people wearing hairnets are observing and capturing photos and videos of a cheese-making process. A person is lifting a large, stretchy mass of curd from a wooden vat using a long wooden stick."></p>
<p>And the stretching is finished when he was able to stretch it above his head.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/30f55337-70d5-4eb7-b29b-2de5746cd98a.jpg" alt="A group of people, wearing hair nets, watches a cheesemaker demonstrating the process of making cheese in a rustic, stone-vaulted room. The cheesemaker is pulling and stretching the cheese curds, which are cascading into a wooden barrel."></p>
<p>After all the stretching, he started to shape it by hand, demonstrating 4 different shapes: knots, braids, ball, and burrata.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/777f6c14-d319-4397-88af-0f307579c118.jpg" alt="A group of people watching a demonstration of traditional cheese-making. The instructor is handling fresh cheese curds, pulling them into a stretchy mass. Various bowls and a wooden bucket with a milk-based liquid are on a metal countertop. "></p>
<p>But the highlight was being able to shape the cheese ourselves! Here&rsquo;s Beth making burrata, which is stretchy mozzarella filled with stracciatella (strips of mozzarella	and cream). We got to eat what we made and it was the best! So fresh and flavorful. I&rsquo;ve never had burrata this good before.</p>

They are wearing hygienic hairnets and aprons. One person is pressing curd into a mozzarella ball over a wooden vat filled with milk, while the other observes."></p>
<p>Later, we headed to a beach club, or lido as they are called in Italy, to relax and sleep off our cheese comas.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a8e4ef29-163e-4661-914a-d96c64db1602.jpg" alt="A tranquil beach scene featuring a sandy shore, calm blue waters, and rocky outcrops adorned with trees and shrubs. The sky is clear and blue. Buoys float in the water."></p>
<p>Dinner was in Capitolo which is right up the coast from the lido.</p>

<p>A sample of the fresh seafood they had that night. We ended up eating the lobster and scorpion fish.</p>

<p>Sunset at Capitolo was very pretty!</p>

<p>The next day we visited the seaside town of Monopoli.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c2e3ec7b-03f7-4683-b3e6-370b4f56b45f.jpg" alt="Narrow pedestrian street adorned with Italian flag bunting.

<p>A cool portal onto the harbor.</p>

<p>The harbor was very beautiful.</p>

Cornelia&rdquo; docked at a waterfront with several other boats nearby. The boat is moored in clear turquoise water against a backdrop of historic buildings with a mix of white and stone facades. "></p>
<p>Monopoli is still an active port, yet remains very scenic.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7e6e5973-89f3-434f-8dcf-662560031dd8.jpg" alt="A scenic view of a harbor with crystal-clear turquoise water and a rocky shoreline. There are two cranes on the pier, extending into the blue sky, which is clear with only a few wispy clouds. The horizon line separates the sea from the sky. "></p>
<p>The streets of Monopoli are beautiful as well. I love the white render buildings and the white stone streets.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ec324f2a-ded6-44ba-ab71-08c269009b94.jpg" alt="The image shows an old stone building with a tower, featuring intricate architectural details, standing under a clear blue sky.

<p>Ok, a quick break to show the Italian way to make caff√® Lecce, as we learned from our guide on the bike tour. The drink is named after the city of Lecce and is served as espresso with a side of almond syrup and ice.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f74ad951-7af3-46bd-9d62-01162aa07f3a.jpg" alt="The image shows a glass of almond syrup with ice, a cup of espresso on a saucer with a spoon, and a bottle of water labeled &ldquo;Ferrarelle.&rdquo; They are placed on a beige perforated table."></p>
<p>You pour the espresso into the glass, letting the cup rest upside down to make sure every drop of espresso makes it in.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/000226e5-6035-4768-9102-42a14f0db7e5.jpg" alt="A white coffee cup is placed upside down inside a glass filled with a two-layered liquid, coffee and almond syrup.

<p>Then you stir it together and enjoy. I love this drink. I&rsquo;ll have to try and find the right kind of almond syrup in the US so I can make this at home.</p>

<p>After Monopoli we headed to a Polignano a Mare, which is another seaside town famous for its beach and cliffs with sea caves. Here we had a boat tour, which was a great way to see the coast.</p>
<p>Beth gets the photo credit for all the pics from the boat.</p>

<p>Here, the very famous beach.</p>

<p>Our guide even took the boat into a few of the larger caves, to our surprise! The water inside was beautiful</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/249fe5b1-7696-44a9-923a-7d190ad12cba.jpg" alt="A small boat navigating close to a rocky cliff with a shallow cave.

<p>Inside this cave, you can see the pathway up above, which is actually a very high end restaurant built into the upper part of the cave with views out onto the sea.</p>

<p>The streets of Polignano a Mare at night, showing some lights celebrating the song &ldquo;Nel blu, dipinto di blu&rdquo; by Domenico Modugno who was born in Polignano. There&rsquo;s even a statue of him that we saw from the boat. However, our guide told us that the statue and celebration of Domenico is just for the tourists and the people from Polignano don&rsquo;t like the signer because he claimed to be from Sicily rather than his true birthplace of Polignano a Mare.</p>

The sky is a gradient from dark blue to a faint orange horizon, and the architecture showcases a blend of modern and old structures. "></p>
<p>Our next day we headed for a cheese tasting at Baby Dicecca, which is located inside a forest preserve. We were lucky enough to meet the cheese maker himself, Vito Dicecca, who was very nice. He stopped by our table a few times to chat with us and see what we thought of his cheese. We tasted a lot of cheese, and they were all great, but his signature blue cheese served as a cake topped with cherry was the star!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b3d8e64d-496c-4c3c-bbb9-c50f8a541622.jpg" alt="A slice of cake topped with berries is on a speckled cake stand, accompanied by a fork. There is a wine bottle in the background. In the foreground, a yellow plate labeled &ldquo;BABY DICECCA&rdquo; is visible. "></p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, we fought off our cheese comas and headed to Matera for a tour of the city.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5d1b46cf-b7c0-4412-a335-65ce505a0ded.jpg" alt="A panoramic view of the historic town of Matera, Italy, featuring ancient stone buildings densely packed on a hillside, winding narrow streets, and a prominent church with a tall bell tower. The landscape around the town consists of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation."></p>
<p>We learned the history of Matera, which is vast. The civilization originally started as cave dwellings carved into the rock cliffs along the stream. Over time, people built on top of the caves, adding stonework to create buildings. However, every building is at least partially carved into the rock. Many buildings have vast caves below them. At least, if you were well off you could afford to have a building above ground. Many of the poorer residents lived entirely in caves with no access to fresh air.</p>
<p>What was shocking was to learn how by the 1950s the city was in very rough shape. There was no running water or electricity. All of the residents were living life as if it was still the 1800s. Malaria and other diseases ran rampant as it was impossible to maintain modern hygiene.</p>
<p>The government eventually stepped in and evicted everyone from the historic part of the city, into new public houses that was constructed adjacent to the historic buildings. So, from the 1950s until about 1990, the historic buildings sat vacant. Our tour guide told us that at one point, the government considered just demolishing the historic city, but abandoned the idea when they determined the amount of dynamite needed would be too costly</p>
<p>So, the city sat vacant until the 1990s. At this point, the government decided to try and create a tourist destination. Modern utilities were installed and buildings were rented out to businesses. But, things didn&rsquo;t really catch on until about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, the city is in full tourist mode, with Michelin star restaurants and 5 star hotels.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/69ef0327-11a1-4b2f-a6b4-f63cfdcc2ccf.jpg" alt="Historic stone buildings densely packed on a hillside under a cloudy sky. Stone-paved pathway descends through the middle, with a few parked cars visible at the bottom. The architecture features a mix of arches, stairs, and balconies with weathered textures."></p>
<p>However, it can be a surprising mix, as you&rsquo;ll pass buildings and areas of the city that still look completely abandoned and right next door is a swanky hotel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c1cb94f2-c9cc-4b10-85b3-2c5f5cc27e13.jpg" alt="A historic stone structure with a weathered, rustic appearance.

A crow perched on a wire above the scene. Vegetation is growing from some areas, and there is a small stone planter with plants in the center."></p>
<p>Another view of the historic city. I found Matera to be so fascinating and intriguing. It&rsquo;s hard to fathom that people have been living here for so long and how hard that life must have been.</p>

<p>And that brings us to the end of our highlights from Puglia. I really loved this region of Italy. The countryside is beautiful, and we had some of the best food of our trip here. If you visit Italy, I&rsquo;d highly recommend Puglia. It can be a lot less touristy compared to Tuscany and gives you an opportunity for more authentic experience.</p>
<p>So, we have tonight in Rome, then we&rsquo;ve reached the end of our time in Italy. It&rsquo;s been fantastic! I&rsquo;m happy that we were able to see the big attractions in Rome and Florence and then spend substantial time in the countrysides of Tuscany and Puglia. It&rsquo;ll be hard to leave Italy!</p>
<p>Ciao!</p>

			 <p>Ciao from Noci in the Puglia region of Italy!</p>
<p>Get ready for a giant, image heavy post about our time in Tuscany! There&rsquo;s so much beautiful scenery, I absolutely failed to edit this down.</p>
<p>To start, and a big highlight of this part of our trip, was the Tuscan villa and farm where we stayed. This was outside Montefollonico with views of Montepulciano in the distance.</p>
<p>It was like a fairytale!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2e26bf95-37b9-41d6-af3a-a4090c3b7b56.jpg" alt="A rustic stone house surrounded by lush greenery and flowering plants, set against a backdrop of rolling hills and a clear blue sky."></p>

<p>I mean, they even had this rabbit that lives in the yard behind our room.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the view of Montepulciano.</p>

<p>On our first full day, we set out to explore the countryside around Montepulciano by e-bike. This region is famous for its wine production and beautiful medieval and Renaissance era town.</p>

<p>Admiring the view shortly after we set off on the e-bikes. At first, I was skeptical that we&rsquo;d need a mountain bike. By the end, I realized why. Some of our route was on essentially farm roads that could be gravel and fairly rough. Even with an e-bike, the hills here are a challenge!</p>

The individual is wearing a helmet and casual attire. A green car is parked near an orange fence on the left, and lush greenery extends across the landscape. "></p>
<p>But the views were worth it!</p>

The town has a mix of medieval buildings, which blend seamlessly into the verdant landscape."></p>
<p>This is a very typical Tuscan scene with the cypress tree and gravel road.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/966b38d5-d970-48b0-b2c7-e974da00d655.jpg" alt="A gravel road running through a rural landscape with greenery and rolling hills in the background. On the right side of the road, there is an old, rustic stone building with a tiled roof, and a tall, narrow cypress tree stands nearby. "></p>
<p>The route the bike shop provided included some stops for wine tasting. I loved how informal it was here at Boscarelli. These vineyards really are small operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/d54e5316-ce82-47c6-8517-0027c6413c20.jpg" alt="A rustic wooden table with various items, including wine bottles, glasses, papers, and a smartphone case.

<p>Of course, Montepulciano has a beautiful church.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0aaf008f-459e-48d2-96ef-6de3e84deb0c.jpg" alt="Interior of a historic church with an ornate altar, stone statues, and religious frescoes on the arched ceiling.

<p>More views from Montepulciano.</p>

<p>Next few days we did some driving itineraries to see more of the countryside and the small Tuscan towns.</p>
<p>First up was Trequanda.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/788509dc-669e-44a1-9f76-406ba1181c65.jpg" alt="A medieval stone tower with a cylindrical shape, featuring small windows, a conical roof, and an overhanging battlement. The tower is situated next to a winding road with trees and vegetation nearby. A partly cloudy sky is visible in the background. "></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a6acfae1-cb33-49d1-9bd1-2953dea9863a.jpg" alt="Narrow, cobblestone street in a quaint town with stone buildings. Brightly colored flowers in window boxes on the left side and a wooden door framed by steps in the background. A yellow building with green shutters is on the right side."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/40e0ecef-61ad-4b5f-9afc-da843cd791b9.jpg" alt="A narrow cobblestone alleyway lined with rustic stone buildings featuring green shutters and flowering plants. The alleyway curves gently with an archway visible in the distance under a partly cloudy sky."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/303ce211-1df6-42b4-bde8-e3c5caa09051.jpg" alt="A person wearing a plaid shirt, denim shorts, and red sneakers is posing under a stone archway. They have a crossbody bag and are looking up with hands on their hips. The background features stone walls and potted plants."></p>
<p>Also great views from Trequanda. We are beginning to see the pattern that Tuscan towns are built on the hilltops, creating great views of the landscapes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b7e7b128-83a5-44c4-9bb0-b4de100dae4e.jpg" alt="A scenic landscape featuring a lush, green valley with rows of olive trees and dense forest-covered hills. Scattered houses are visible, nestled among the trees, and mountains can be seen in the distance under a clear sky."></p>
<p>We visited another winery and agriturismo. This one, called Fattoria del Colle is run by women. Again, it&rsquo;s a small operation.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9b49b8c2-b2a9-4c7d-9c03-85a8584619ff.jpg" alt="This image shows the interior of a winery cellar with various barrels and tanks used for storing and aging wine. There are large wooden barrels, a ceramic fermentation tank, and stainless steel vats. The space features brick arches, rustic decorations, and industrial elements. "></p>
<p>More great views.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cece8493-1403-4fbb-bb61-888a8c79b046.jpg" alt="Rolling countryside with green fields and wooded areas under a cloudy sky. Dirt paths weave through the landscape, and distant hills are visible on the horizon. A serene, natural setting."></p>
<p>We visited a small olive oil producer, met the owner and got the full tour. It was really fun to learn about the process, seeing the older machinery (big granite wheels) alongside the newer (centrifuges that reduce contact with air).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/13fbcb02-895a-4a8f-bd96-fc1b495c7dfe.jpg" alt="An olive oil mill facility with machinery including a granite millstone crusher, a metal conveyor, and various stainless steel processing units. The floor is tiled, and the room is well-lit with overhead fluorescent lights."></p>
<p>This small, family run operation puts out some great olive oil!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/61faaac2-f26f-40de-a4fd-cdf0719186ba.jpg" alt="The image shows a display of various bottles of extra virgin olive oil on a small wooden table. The bottles are of different sizes and have different colored caps."></p>
<p>They make several D.O.P. oils and this cloth details the Siena D.O.P. region.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/155ebf0c-16fb-404e-843f-d6ffe2952717.jpg" alt="A detailed cloth map depicts the production area for D.O.P. Terre di Siena olive oil in the province of Siena, Tuscany. It highlights various localities involved in olive oil production. "></p>
<p>Next up was Chiusure, which is adjacent to this valley of rugged, eroded landscape.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/29095006-5946-439b-b0f4-7d11086f40cf.jpg" alt="A panoramic view of a hilly landscape featuring rugged, white chalk formations and lush green vegetation. Rolling hills and dense forests stretch into the distance, with patches of farmland visible under a clear, light blue sky."></p>
<p>Just outside town was this monastery with this monk statue turned up to 11.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ee6c0ec8-ab74-4630-8a80-6eee6d408dbd.jpg" alt="A tall brick church with a clock tower and arched windows under a sunny sky. In front of the church, a white marble statue depicts a robed figure standing on a stone pedestal. The area around the church and statue is paved with red bricks. "></p>
<p>Lucignano was the next town we saw. I thought the streets here were very photogenic.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/46a3c8b6-94cd-4858-913a-56da4d1ddab2.jpg" alt="A person stands in the middle of a narrow, cobblestone alleyway flanked by tall, ancient stone buildings with green shutters.

Two people walk down the steps towards an archway. Greenery and trees are visible in the background, adding to the scene&rsquo;s charm."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/102d4a91-9c60-48c0-9af6-d3c1fa7153f8.jpg" alt="A rustic stone courtyard with potted plants and vibrant flowers arranged against the walls. Decorative plates are mounted on the walls. Above, a bell tower with two bells is visible, and the weathering on the stone walls suggests the structure is historic. "></p>

The street is lined with aged, stone buildings adorned with green window shutters and flower pots. Lamps hang from the sides of buildings. "></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool to see the town walls and entryways. Some (most?) date back to the Etruscan civilization. However, the walls have been reinforced and rebuilt over the centuries.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/03b62352-8b06-417d-a8ff-176c7fa42d5a.jpg" alt="A historical stone archway with a medieval crest above it, situated in a rustic town. Black, white, and grey flags are draped over the wall."></p>
<p>Dinner in a castle? Why not?</p>

The structure includes both medieval and Renaissance architectural elements with a large, grassy courtyard and a gravel path leading to the entrance."></p>
<p>The dining area had some unexpected modern touches. Food was great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3de52a4a-92ff-416a-ad16-5cdcc08e0e9d.jpg" alt="A cozy dining area with rustic wooden beams and shelves filled with wine bottles. The tables are set with glasses, cutlery, and candles. A neon sign reading &ldquo;bottega&rdquo; is illuminated in pink on the back wall, adding a modern touch. "></p>
<p>Next was Monticchiello, which also had great views.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cd47d6bd-65ee-48b4-8e33-3b3e5d7de604.jpg" alt="A scenic view of rolling hills in the countryside, featuring patches of green fields, clusters of trees, and winding roads. In the distance, there is a hilltop town under a partly cloudy sky."></p>

They are wearing a denim dress over a red shirt and sandals. The alley is surrounded by greenery and trees, and a partly cloudy sky is visible. "></p>
<p>And the town itself was very picturesque.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1f7413cf-33a3-422f-96bb-b5e9445236bd.jpg" alt="A person stands on the steps of a large, historical stone building with a grand wooden door.

<p>This small town had quite the history full of combat and attempts to breach the town walls. We learned about the documentary called Spettacolo that&rsquo;s about the theatrical event put on in the town square every year. We definitely will have to give this a watch!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9d097c32-de39-4595-838a-f8af704a3082.jpg" alt="A historic stone archway leads into a cobblestone street lined with old buildings. The cloudy sky adds to the rustic atmosphere."></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what looks like a regular cup of espresso, but it has a bit of grappa added to it. It tasted great. In Italian it&rsquo;s usually called caff√® corretto which translates as &ldquo;corrected coffee&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/785f252a-9e66-45b3-a26b-5e3fbef0d12e.jpg" alt="A Lavazza-branded white espresso cup and saucer filled with espresso, placed on a table. A metal spoon rests on the saucer. In the background, there are green plants and a wooden table number stand with the number 14."></p>
<p>The next town we visited was Pienza, which is famous for being a Renaissance era planned city in the style of Humanism. It was the home of Pope Pius II who oversaw the construction and eventually returned to live here.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5c2e5221-8a41-4ec5-9c39-43416db09bb3.jpg" alt="A scenic view featuring a stone wall leading to a large historic building with Gothic-style windows.

<p>A view of the piazza.</p>

The building displays Italian and European Union flags. The sky is partly cloudy."></p>
<p>During the equinoxes, the shadow of this cathedral fills the square, mirroring the image of its facade.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/589b0a07-907e-4cb7-b7f2-7b164e7e5cdf.jpg" alt="Facade of a Renaissance-style cathedral with three grand wooden doors, intricate architectural details, and symmetrical design. The setting is a stone-paved square with a few people standing near the building under a partly cloudy sky."></p>
<p>This building was the home of Pius II and his family.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7fc11317-3678-46d1-b841-999a778d081e.jpg" alt="The image depicts the interior courtyard of a historic building, featuring an open atrium with arched columns and two levels of windows.

Above the arches is a stone wall with faded frescoes and an ornamental carving. Beyond the doorway at the center is a garden pathway lined with hedges leading to a distant view of a lake. "></p>
<p>Forget the history, the view was the best part. Must have been good to be the Pope.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e6142efc-33ca-4ceb-827d-974f00f713d6.jpg" alt="A picturesque landscape featuring a well-manicured formal garden with neatly trimmed bushes and hedges. Beyond the garden, there is an old stone wall partially overgrown with greenery. The backdrop showcases rolling hills, fields, and distant mountains. "></p>
<p>Oh and you&rsquo;ve gotta taste the pecorino cheese that is made here and is world famous.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e510a75b-96d1-4603-8e78-06ca3b53ab02.jpg" alt="A person in a blue shirt cuts a slice of cheese on a wooden board in a cheese shop. Various types of cheese, small jars of condiments, and bottles of balsamic vinegar are displayed on the wooden counter. "></p>
<p>After the cheese, we walked just out of town past this old church&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/36e89969-588f-4aa5-9fe1-082b0c422acd.jpg" alt="A historic stone church with a cylindrical tower and arched entrance, surrounded by lush green grass and leafy trees under a partly cloudy sky."></p>
<p>To this view. If it looks familiar, it&rsquo;s because it was used for a scene in the movie Gladiator.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6fabbd02-69cc-43e1-b9c4-13d70c97cf53.jpg" alt="A scenic landscape of rolling hills with golden fields and green patches. A winding dirt road lined with cypress trees runs through the fields, leading to a distant farmhouse. In the background, there is a range of blue and green mountains under a partly cloudy sky. "></p>
<p>The next place we visited was Castiglione del Lago, which, as its name suggests, is next to Lago (Lake) Trasimeno.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5bcb9405-efca-4b52-860f-4627413129ad.jpg" alt="A historical town square featuring a medieval clock tower with a bell, flanked by buildings with green shutters and balconies. In the foreground, there is a stone fountain, and to the right, a caf√© with outdoor seating under a red awning. "></p>
<p>We bought a ticket to walk the fortress battlements and it was totally worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c5dec5ce-84c4-48a5-852c-d84dd75a0f60.jpg" alt="A section of an old brick and stone fortress wall with gaps, overlooking a body of water with mountains in the background.

The arch leads to a staircase with metal railings, ascending towards buildings in the background. Vegetation grows through the stonework at various points, and cobblestones line the pathway under. "></p>
<p>Next stop, the town of Cortona, which was built on terraces cut into the hillside. It has these amazing, ancient walls.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a164e71e-a744-468a-b108-1b4f159fcc0d.jpg" alt="A charming town square with historic buildings and rustic architecture.

<p>A cool celestial globe I spotted.</p>

The globe features detailed illustrations of constellations with mythological figures and celestial coordinates.

<p>I really liked the streets of Cortona. It had taller buildings than we were used to seeing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/31b789c8-2441-4733-89e8-460ca87ec91c.jpg" alt="Narrow street in a historic European town, lined with stone buildings and colorful banners.

<p>Just outside of town is another monastery. This one is beautifully set into the stream&rsquo;s valley.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b52f00e7-1a8c-4495-beb3-6710e18ed87e.jpg" alt="A scenic view of an ancient building with clay-tiled roofs set against a backdrop of lush green hills and forests.

<p>And that was it for our time in Tuscany! Thanks for reading through the post. We absolutely loved our time there and would go back in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>But Puglia was calling. So we headed back to Florence to take the train to Bari via Rome.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/db39d6d6-fda8-4030-ae39-318cc0fb4881.jpg" alt="A modern high-speed train on a railway track at a train station, with another train visible in the background. It is a sunny day with clear blue skies, and the station platform is partially shaded. "></p>
<p>Ciao! I&rsquo;ll have another report on Puglia. Sadly, this is our last stop before we head home!</p>

			 <p>Buonasera from Tuscany! Tonight&rsquo;s post has the highlights from our time in Florence. We&rsquo;ve been in Tuscany for a few days now and it&rsquo;s taken me a while to get this post together because there&rsquo;s so much I wanted to cover even though we only had 2 nights in Florence. And the WiFi and cell isn&rsquo;t great in Tuscany, so it&rsquo;s taken a bit to get all these photos uploaded.</p>
<p>Back to the start of this leg of the trip, we took the train from Roma Termini to Florence. Roma Termini was surprisingly good. It was clean and had a nice design. We got coffee before our train was ready to board and it was a nice experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f81cf4f4-b1d5-4630-891e-c1be6203d6a6.jpg" alt="A woman is standing in a train terminal, smiling at the camera. She is holding a tote bag with small heart designs and wearing a light blue T-shirt, beige shorts, red sneakers, glasses, and a wristwatch."></p>
<p>Our high speed Frecciarossa to Florence.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/203eae3a-2aea-4eb4-a080-035521fbb233.jpg" alt="A modern high-speed train at a station platform under a clear blue sky. The train has a red and silver design, with the number &ldquo;22&rdquo; visible on its front. Another similar train is on an adjacent track. "></p>
<p>The first highlight from Florence was Palazzo Vecchio, which was the home of the Medici family during the Renaissance. And if you know anything about the Medicis, you know how humble and plain they were. Their home reflected that.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/06515d77-adcf-4e29-9904-134942c8c579.jpg" alt="This image shows an interior courtyard featuring ornate columns, arched ceilings with detailed frescoes, and upper windows with stone frames. In the center, there is a fountain with a small statue on top. The courtyard is decorated with historical and artistic elements. "></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/538b48d1-ddd5-4f7a-ad5b-4a63e6a69bac.jpg" alt="An ornate interior scene of a historic hall or chapel featuring a high, intricately decorated ceiling with detailed paintings and gold embellishments.

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a10a90c7-2800-4d74-bc88-2c624e14bc1d.jpg" alt="Ornate ceiling painting framed with intricate gold detailing. The central circular painting depicts a regal figure holding a crown, surrounded by cherubs and shields. Latin inscriptions adorn the frame."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9d8e0b57-0654-4a0c-8175-8e73c980c16e.jpg" alt="A marble sculpture depicting two male figures in a dynamic struggle. One figure stands over the other, holding a large wooden club raised above his head, while the other figure lies beneath, attempting to defend himself with an arm raised."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0688651d-9030-46cc-a5ec-03d1f33da3e7.jpg" alt="A grand hall with an ornate, gilded ceiling and large, detailed frescoes depicting historical battle scenes on the walls. Statues line the perimeter of the hall below the frescoes. The hall features tall arched windows and a few visitors walking. "></p>
<p>One of my favorite rooms here was the map room, which had detailed maps of all the world that was known to them during the Renaissance.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/33525d8f-e656-4c4e-a91a-ae59fa45100b.jpg" alt="A large, antique globe is displayed in the center of a room surrounded by wooden paneling and world maps. The ceiling is ornately decorated, and the globe is enclosed by ropes to keep viewers at a distance. "></p>

<p>A view of the Duomo.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1d1c0a5d-1ef3-4c22-9219-177e90610877.jpg" alt="A cityscape featuring the dome of the Florence Cathedral (Duomo di Firenze) in the center, with surrounding historic buildings and rooftops. The sky above is blue with scattered clouds."></p>

Surrounding the statue is a crowd of tourists. The stone facade of the Palazzo Vecchio and a blue banner for the museum are visible. "></p>
<p>All of central Florence is a beautiful Renaissance city.</p>

Illuminated buildings line the riverbank, with reflections dancing on the water. A bridge crosses the river in the background, with a lit tower visible in the distance under a clear blue sky. "></p>
<p>The next highlight is the Uffizi Gallery, which is right next to Palazzo Vecchio on Piazza della Signoria. The Uffizi was originally built by the Medicis as an administrative building. Now it houses mainly Renaissance era works of art. Some pieces are older and were acquired by the Medicis and other collectors.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dc46e214-9814-457f-a52f-d38f6f2ffea4.jpg" alt="A marble bust of a bearded man with flowing hair, depicted with a stern expression.

The artwork is mounted on a round shield-like surface."></p>
<p>A bridge covered with buildings that are now mostly high end shops.</p>

The buildings on the bridge have brightly colored facades and numerous windows."></p>
<p>Just happened to walk past this print shop while they were at work. You could smell the ink as we walked past.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/09575fc4-719b-43fa-a153-8295377356e2.jpg" alt="A small, cozy art studio with arched ceilings and exposed brick walls. The walls are adorned with various framed artworks, including botanical prints, portraits, and maps. A person is working at a table toward the back of the room. "></p>
<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s talk about the food. It has been consistently good the entire time we&rsquo;ve been in Italy. But the pasta at <a href="https://www.cibreo.com/caffe/">Cibr√®o Caffe</a> was amazing.</p>
<p>Spinach and ricotta tortelloni.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/08dd63ca-f3ff-4940-a48c-06fca759150c.jpg" alt="A plate of green and yellow tortelloni with grated cheese on top, served with light sauce on a white plate."></p>
<p>Cacio e burro.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/89f82b9e-8006-4282-a6a6-120269f0ee03.jpg" alt="A white plate containing a serving of creamy pasta, likely tagliatelle, topped with grated cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper. The dish is called cachio e burro. "></p>
<p>Had to have pizza at least once during this trip, and this was our first. I had this quattro formagi and enjoyed it. I&rsquo;m learning that I like almost anything with Gorgonzola on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6a396a0b-5b86-4881-a370-6cf0e08aaca9.jpg" alt="A fresh, cheese-covered pizza on a dark plate, served with a glass of water. The table includes additional items, such as a bottle cap and a water bottle in the background."></p>
<p>Next highlight is the Duomo. The facade is most intricate I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b782a186-2f74-4d46-b2b3-ae69e0fa4fa1.jpg" alt="This image shows the intricate and ornate facade of Florence Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, in Florence, Italy. The focus is on the central main doors, which are richly decorated with religious carvings and sculptures. "></p>
<p>The interior is austere by comparison, but still beautiful. Check out the clock that was describe as working on &ldquo;Italian time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ffabbb86-fe26-4079-b0a2-ea261afaf0ac.jpg" alt="The image shows the interior of a historic cathedral, featuring a large ornate clock on the wall above a dark wooden door, flanked by intricate stone carvings and religious frescoes.

The vaulted ceiling displays intricate fresco paintings, and stained glass windows illuminate the space. A prominent cross stands at the altar, framed by columns."></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the recap of Florence! We saw so many incredible things, it&rsquo;s impossible to capture it all.</p>
<p>Next, we picked up a rental car and headed into the Tuscan countryside. I&rsquo;ll recap our time in Tuscany in the next post!</p>
<p>Buonanotte!</p>

			 <p>Ciao from on board the Frecciarossa high speed train to Florence!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7d591c8e-6788-4a22-8aa1-88092b69297e.jpg" alt="Two modern red high-speed trains are parked at an urban train station under a clear blue sky. An overhead power line system is visible above the trains."></p>
<p>Rome was incredible! It&rsquo;s hard to capture everything in one post, just like it&rsquo;s hard to capture like 2,500 years of history in a few days in Rome! Still, here&rsquo;s the highlights!</p>
<p>I successfully linked up with my beautiful wife, Beth, in the late afternoon on June 2. We had some drinks and a bit at the hotel, before we went out later for more drinks and dinner.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/115f6e04-6cff-4a86-8d55-891959d74cd3.jpg" alt="A person standing on a cobblestone street in Rome, surrounded by narrow buildings with wooden shutters and ornate doorways. The individual is wearing a patterned dress and red shoes, and is holding a phone, with a crossbody bag."></p>
<p>The next day was all about the Colosseum and Roman Forum. It&rsquo;s hard to describe how amazing it is to see this ancient structures and to try to imagine the city during the Roman Empire.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a72f87a0-4e53-480f-a65f-e0648995cb08.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of the Colosseum in Rome, Italy. The structure is partially intact with exposed ancient stone and numerous arches. Visitors are seen walking through the ruins and pathways within the Colosseum under a blue sky filled with scattered clouds."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dc21b4c7-0c9f-4ed8-8a3d-26d79039c381.jpg" alt="Interior of the Colosseum in Rome, featuring ancient stone ruins and structural remains of the amphitheater. Multiple levels of arches and seating are visible, alongside groups of visitors exploring the site. Bright sunny sky above with minimal clouds."></p>

A rectangular reflective pool with water lilies is in the foreground, and scattered statues and grassy areas are visible. People are walking and observing the ruins.

The vast archaeological site is dotted with greenery and visitors exploring. The background features more historic buildings and arches set against a blue sky."></p>
<p>Later, we headed up to see Trevi Fountain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e554177b-49e1-44f2-bbb0-ac80db745eb1.jpg" alt="The image shows the Trevi Fountain, a famous Baroque fountain in Rome, Italy. It features intricate sculptures of mythological figures, including Oceanus standing in the central niche, surrounded by tritons and horses."></p>
<p>Dinner at an enoteca where I loved this paccheri with sausage and asparagus. It was simple, but great! I&rsquo;m now in love with the paccheri pasta shape.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b3efe882-30c2-4bc5-a88c-7e9e23159ee4.jpg" alt="A plate of pasta with large tube-shaped noodles, topped with grated cheese. The pasta appears to be mixed with asparagus and ground meat. The dish is served on a white round plate."></p>
<p>The next day, we started in the morning with a food tour with <a href="https://www.sophieminchilli.com/">Sophie</a>, which was great. We walked around Rome, mostly the Trastevere neighborhood, having small bites as we went. Roman food is great, it&rsquo;s a lot of meat (Mortadella is a local favorite), cheese, and bread, which is just perfect in my book. Even something as simple as tomatoes, cheese, and olive oil was amazing. The tomatoes were probably the best I&rsquo;ve ever had. Don&rsquo;t forget the baked goods, like the cookies from this bakery, which is the oldest in Rome.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/595dafa9-d263-42ce-a257-ebe1278bd244.jpg" alt="A quaint bakery with a vintage aesthetic. Various baked goods, including bread and pastries, are displayed on counters and shelves. A woman in a red shirt is working behind the counter. The bakery features large baking equipment and a glass display case."></p>
<p>One of the things about Rome is how you will see ancient ruins and stunning buildings everywhere you go in the city center.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0d37a312-c00a-45ae-87fb-9d032843aa42.jpg" alt="The image depicts the ruins of an ancient Roman temple complex, surrounded by modern buildings, some trees, and columns. The sky is clear and sunny."></p>
<p>Here the legendary Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/44e50323-1c3e-4cda-be01-eab46764360e.jpg" alt="A statue of the Capitoline Wolf suckling Romulus and Remus is mounted on an ornate column in front of an old building with stone and brick walls. The background features sculpted plaques and architectural details. The scene is situated in an outdoor urban setting."></p>
<p>A picturesque street.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a6827e2c-0433-43a6-810b-934aa82e199c.jpg" alt="A narrow cobblestonek street with people walking in both directions. The street is lined with old buildings featuring shutters, balconies, and some greenery. An ATM machine is visible on the left side near a building entrance. Bright sunlight filters through the buildings."></p>
<p>I loved this weird fountain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e7ec59bd-5d0a-418e-9f7c-f3508cbd6511.jpg" alt="A stone fountain with a grotesque face sculpture has water flowing from its mouth into a basin below. The backdrop includes an old brick wall and parts of nearby buildings, with green trees and a blue sky in the background."></p>
<p>Dinner last night was at <a href="https://www.daenzoal29.com/">Trattoria da Enzo</a> in Trastevere. I had no idea how popular this restaurant was, until we showed up and saw the giant line! They serve traditional Roman food. We loved the carbonara, amatriciana, and meatballs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6260c73a-1c36-4d2e-977e-2503415c1b72.jpg" alt="A busy narrow street in an urban area with people queuing outside a building, likely a popular restaurant or cafe. The street is lined with old buildings featuring shutters on windows. The crowd includes people looking at their phones and conversing. "></p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll be arriving in Florence shortly. We&rsquo;ll have 2 nights here before we pick up a car and head out to Tuscany.</p>
<p>Ciao!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ciao from Rome! With my arrival in Rome, this marks the end of my solo journey that started in London, England. I&rsquo;ve managed to make it all this way with nothing but train travel and my own two feet!</p>
<p>Milano centrale.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c6621719-b13f-4e34-99ba-832faef650f2.jpg" alt="A modern train station platform with railway tracks beside it under a large arched, glass-roofed canopy. A digital clock and departure information display are visible overhead. There are ticket vending machines labeled &ldquo;Self Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Biglietti&rdquo;. "></p>
<p>But before reflecting further, here&rsquo;s my ride from Milan. This is Trenitalia&rsquo;s Frecciarossa high speed train model ETR 1000, which I believe is the newer engine and cars.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/41dcd48f-14e3-47f2-be6d-ddac0cf67bb7.jpg" alt="A modern red high-speed train is stationed on a platform in a large, arched train station with a glass and metal roof. Passengers are standing on the platform near the train. A second train is visible on a neighboring track."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/009aeb95-3237-4cf3-858d-3d4662a90460.jpg" alt="The image shows a Frecciarossa 1000 train labeled &ldquo;PREMIUM&rdquo; at a train station. The train&rsquo;s window and carriage number 4 are visible. "></p>
<p>The cabin on this car is a little bit nicer than my equivalent TGV from Paris to Lyon. This is also where I wrote the majority of this post.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/46f6c82e-d14e-454c-98b8-3bafd9c2cde1.jpg" alt="Interior of a high-speed train, specifically a Frecciarossa train by Trenitalia. The image shows rows of seats with red headrest covers, a table with a water bottle, and an electronic device. The train window displays blurred greenery outside. "></p>
<p>Arriving into Roma Termini.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1b865eac-a963-4db0-bae2-787a5c9e89dc.jpg" alt="A busy interior of a train station with travelers pulling suitcases and standing in line. The station features a high ceiling, large digital displays, and various shops along both sides. The floor is tiled in black."></p>
<p>Overall the trip went smoothly. One thing that surprised me was how many tunnels, long completely dark tunnels, this trip entailed. Looking at the map, it makes sense, as we have to traverse multiple mountain ranges. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be feasible to travel at high speed over the mountains.</p>
<p>My hotel was close enough that I decided to walk.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/035554da-324d-4f15-bc2a-6b54a1a89dab.jpg" alt="A street scene in Rome. The view shows historical buildings with classic architecture on both sides. Scooters and motorcycles are parked along the cobblestone curb. People walk on the sidewalk under an overcast sky."></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that we are staying right next to the Roman Forum. These ruins are steps away from the hotel&rsquo;s front door. It&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that ruins from 2,000 years ago are just right here!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/17691210-d137-4d44-8333-6c796871e3ed.jpg" alt="The image shows the ruins of an ancient stone building, with scattered stone fragments and remnants of columns in a grassy, open area. In the background, there are arched structures, a blue construction tent, and trees. The sky is overcast. "></p>
<p>So, I think now is a good time to reflect on the overall trip. There&rsquo;s so much novel for me in this trip: new countries, new modes of transportation. Despite how unfamiliar I was with all of this, I think things went extremely smoothly. My trains all ran on schedule and I was able to complete each leg of the journey without a hitch.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know now, would I recommend trains, especially high speed trains, as a mode of travel between European cities? Absolutely. For me, traveling like this is just so much more relaxed than flying. If it&rsquo;s realistic to take a train, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d go in the future.</p>
<p>I really wish high speed rail would come to America. I think it enables a type of travel that isn&rsquo;t really possible without it.</p>
<p>Ok, now for some highlights.</p>
<p>Favorite train: Glacier Express. How could I not choose this? It was just over the top in every way.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5aa6800a-bb7c-47e3-8aeb-a166cbe824fa.jpg" alt="The image shows the interior of the Glacier Express train with spacious seating, large windows providing scenic views of lush greenery, houses, and mountains in the background. The seats are arranged around a central table, with clear glasses placed on top. The train has a luxurious"></p>
<p>Favorite non-scenic train: Eurostar from London to Paris. This train had the nicest cabin and best service. Oh and not that this train isn&rsquo;t scenic, the French countryside was beautiful, once you get through the darkness of the Chunnel. The only negative of the Eurostar is having to go through airport like security and passport control. But that&rsquo;s all about Britain and the EU and not the train&rsquo;s fault. But it&rsquo;s notable that this is the only time I&rsquo;ve had to go through security and passport checks like this.</p>

The seats are arranged in pairs, upholstered in grey with yellow accents. Overhead luggage racks hold various bags and suitcases.

<p>Favorite stop: Zermatt, Switzerland. Seeing the Matterhorn both just from the streets of Zermatt where it seems to loom over the town as well as from mountain top via the gondola was absolutely incredible. From my experience, Switzerland is just an incredible country. So beautiful in many regards. I&rsquo;m looking forward to returning someday.</p>

<p>Favorite city: Lyon, France. Historic and beautiful Vieux Lyon, good food, bike friendly. I&rsquo;d like to return and spend more time here!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6e4525a9-1eca-46fe-9d11-f6b87a01ccf6.jpg" alt="Lyon, France, showing the S√¥ane river with a motorboat passing under a concrete bridge. The bridge has streetlights and connects urban areas with historic buildings and dense greenery on the riverbanks. The sky is partly cloudy with blue patches."></p>
<p>Favorite train station: This is harder as I didn&rsquo;t spend too much time in the stations&hellip;but I think it goes to St. Pancras in London. I loved all the glass ceilings and how it seems to mix modern and classic architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a9b138ec-9ca2-4f0d-b761-9d5ff6b874c6.jpg" alt="The image shows the St. Pancras train station platform with people boarding a blue train. The station has a large, intricate arched roof made of steel and glass. A clock is prominently displayed above an entrance with a neon sign beneath it."></p>
<p>So, what next? Here in Rome, I&rsquo;ll be linking up with my wife and we will travel around Italy. I arrived first due to her flight being delayed. (Hahah, train wins!)</p>
<p>I think this will conclude the daily travel reports. But I will try to post some highlights from each part of Italy. We will be staying a few days in Rome, Florence, the Tuscany countryside, then all the way down in Puglia outside Bari, finally back to Rome for our flight home. We will be taking trains to travel from Rome -&gt; Florence and then Florence -&gt; Bari. We looked into flights for the Florence -&gt; Bari leg, but we really couldn&rsquo;t find anything that made more sense than the train.</p>
<p>So, thank you very much for reading and following along with my trip! It&rsquo;s been really incredible. I feel so lucky to have seen so many countries, cities, and sights along the way. I&rsquo;m glad I could share some of it with you all here.</p>
<p>Ciao!</p>

			 <p>Buona sera da Milano! I spent the day wondering around Milan, here&rsquo;s what I got into.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/626bfcda-dd35-4b75-af3a-c2106ad9b1ad.jpg" alt="A cobblestone pedestrian street lined with shops and buildings. Overhead, wires cross the partly cloudy sky. Some people are walking and shopping, with greenery and plants adorning the sides of the path."></p>
<p>The first stop for me today was Castello Sforzesco, a castle from the Renaissance era.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bd6baf84-11ed-4d64-9436-cd21cddc530d.jpg" alt="Image of Sforza Castle (Castello Sforzesco) in Milan, Italy, on a clear day. The castle&rsquo;s central tower and side towers are prominent. There are people walking and gathering near the fountain in the foreground."></p>
<p>It was fun to see the huge courtyards with their impressive architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/be57a0d6-6e48-4358-92ca-020ee4864305.jpg" alt="This image shows an inner courtyard of a historic building with arched windows and columns.

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to look up every now and then!</p>

The background is filled with tiny swirling lines, creating a sense of dynamic movement."></p>
<p>Here they have a room that displays the Rondanini Piet√† which is Michelangelo&rsquo;s last sculpture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5c4ddac5-e735-4ca4-97f3-0c700305f8e9.jpg" alt="A marble sculpture of two intertwined figures stands in the center of a room with vaulted ceilings adorned with frescoes. The sculpture is displayed on a circular podium with a light wooden floor and has soft natural lighting from two large windows."></p>
<p>My next stop is the Duomo di Milano. I&rsquo;m here mostly for the architecture and it&rsquo;s a shame that the tickets to go up on the terraces and roof are all sold out! I did not anticipate that tickets to go up stairs or an elevator would sell out. Wait hours in line, sure. But, I would guess that due to the age of the building they might limit how many people are allowed up.</p>
<p>Still, the building is impressive enough from the plaza.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/62a6c754-9540-4c36-8602-2bee73cb3547.jpg" alt="A large crowd of people stands in front of the Milan Cathedral (Duomo di Milano) on a sunny day.

<p>This is some of the most detailed stained glass I&rsquo;ve ever seen. This one almost looked 3d to me.</p>

The statue depicts an anatomically detailed, muscular figure holding a book and a knife, with a draped cloth over his shoulder."></p>
<p>A square right around the corner from the Duomo.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/db4f9fdc-e874-4732-bb96-e48342ea311d.jpg" alt="A sunlit medieval square with historic buildings, including an arched red-brick structure and other intricate facades. People walk and sit at outdoor cafes while market stalls line a section of the square. The sky is clear and blue."></p>
<p>The sightseeing today was classic Milan, but I think the best part of my day might have been dinner. I was lucky and found a place that seemed less touristy. At least, they did not have an English menu and my waiter did not speak English. Still, it was some of the friendliest service that I&rsquo;ve had since entering Italy. And the food was exactly what I was looking for, really good without being overly fancy or pretentious. I think I did alright ordering in a mix of bad Italian, English, and pointing. One thing I&rsquo;m learning, ChatGPT is pretty helpful with other languages (at least Italian and French). It provides a little more context and guidance than something like Google translate. It certainly helped me navigate this menu for some of the terms I did not recognize.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the dishes I had, it&rsquo;s tagliatelle with pulipo (octopus) and Gorgonzola. When I ordered, I was wondering if the Gorgonzola would be overpowering, but it wasn&rsquo;t! The dish was great and very well balanced.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6b5e27ae-08c1-425e-a515-3e36ffb06450.jpg" alt="A white plate filled with creamy pasta dish, tagliatelle, garnished with octopus. The plate is on a white tablecloth with a fork, wine glass, and glass of water visible around it."></p>
<p>This brings me to the end of my night. Tomorrow, I take the high speed Trenitalia line to Rome!</p>
<p>Buonanotte!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hello from Milan, Italy! I&rsquo;ve reached the final country on my trek and I&rsquo;ve arrived via another world class train line. Today&rsquo;s star was the Bernina Express, which travels between St. Moritz and Tirano, Italy. This line is named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernina_Pass">Bernina Pass</a> through the Alps.</p>
<p>In the last few days, I had been seeing snow in the forecast for St. Moritz. I spoke about the forecasted snow with a few people working at my hotel and they were skeptical that it would snow there this time of year.</p>
<p>So, this morning when I woke up and looked out my window&hellip;sure enough the snow was falling!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/41e1fd95-39ab-4d38-a03f-3aa87afbc00e.jpg" alt="Snow falling over a train station with red trains and a building in the foreground. Trees and a lake are visible in the misty background."></p>
<p>Staff in the hotel continued to tell me this is very abnormal for St. Moritz this time of year. I&rsquo;ll take them at their word and believe that I must be very lucky then to have a train ride in snow today.</p>
<p>And it really did make the passing forests look like a winter wonderland.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f67100ae-b41a-4f40-85ec-af91045575e3.jpg" alt="A serene forest scene with evergreen trees covered in a light layer of snow. The ground is also lightly dusted with snow, creating a calm winter atmosphere. The sky is overcast, and snow is gently falling."></p>
<p>Sure, we couldn&rsquo;t see the mountains or valleys that we&rsquo;d normally see on this route, but I think it was worth it to get a taste of winter in Switzerland. A few passengers sitting nearby agreed it was our lucky day.</p>
<p>After about an hour into the trip, we stopped so passengers could exit and take photos. We were told this is a very scenic location. I&rsquo;ll just have to assume that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b3709644-c92a-4aa7-98ff-57a784dbe014.jpg" alt="A snowy landscape with evergreen trees and sparse bushes. The ground and trees are lightly covered in snow, creating a serene, wintry scene. The sky is overcast, and snowfall can be seen in the background."></p>
<p>Since we really couldn&rsquo;t see anything much in the distance, I decided to photograph the snowy train instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5de33f5a-b460-466b-afce-d4d35a803882.jpg" alt="A red, snow-covered train car with large windows, labeled &ldquo;Bernina Express,&rdquo; is stopped in a snowy landscape. Snowflakes are visible in the air, and the setting appears to be a cold, wintry environment."></p>

The tracks and the surrounding area are covered with snow. Overhead, electric lines span above the train, and a hill with some buildings is visible in the background under a light snowfall."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6fec3645-3bb4-49f3-ba94-1c4b281fb396.jpg" alt="A person wearing a hooded jacket and smiling while taking a selfie in a snowy setting. Behind them, there is a red and white Bernina Express train. Snow is visibly falling and accumulating on the person&rsquo;s clothing and beard."></p>
<p>When we got underway again and slowly began our decent, the snow turned to rain and the forests became more dense and green.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3536e2a4-9ef0-40d2-b6b1-3e9a0854fb9c.jpg" alt="A scenic landscape featuring lush green fields, winding paths, and a few scattered houses, all set against a backdrop of forested hills partially obscured by fog and mist."></p>
<p>Looking at the weather radar, it the snow really seemed to be isolated just to the area around St. Moritz.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/19aa4b55-711e-4e79-ae66-01484d7751a1.jpg" alt="A weather map showing temperature gradients in a region that includes cities like Davos, St. Moritz, and Livigno. The map uses color coding to indicate different temperature zones. Snow is indicated in a ring around St. Moritz. "></p>
<p>As we traveled along, one of the notable sights was this 360 degree spiral viaduct. I always enjoy when the curve is tight enough to see the cars ahead of us.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/56bc433c-5784-42ed-bf6d-2d30c1b34e16.jpg" alt="A red train traveling over a stone viaduct surrounded by lush, green landscape and hills. The foreground features a rail, and the image is slightly blurred and streaked, possibly due to raindrops on the camera lens."></p>
<p>Shortly after the viaduct, we arrived in Tirano, Italy! The Bernina Express describes itself as &ldquo;from glaciers to palms&rdquo; and sure enough I did see palm trees in Tirano! What a ride to go from the snow to palm trees in about 2 hours.</p>
<p>I thought it was interesting that the Bernina Express basically runs right through the heart of this small town, almost operating as a street car. When you exit, you are in a small square. Here&rsquo;s the building that serves as the entrance to the railway to Switzerland.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0a38c4f0-ae0a-438b-9d42-669350daa8de.jpg" alt="A person in an orange jacket standing at the entrance of a building adorned with Italian and European Union flags. The building has a white facade with red vertical accents and multiple windows. The ground is paved with cobblestones."></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the building for the Italian train service, operating under the name Trenord.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/fc995b0a-1ade-4de8-ad5c-9f773902dd49.jpg" alt="A yellow-painted train station building with a clock at the top center. The station has a tiled roof, several windows with closed shutters, and arched doorways at the ground level. There are signs and a poster board in front of the building. "></p>
<p>I had lunch in Tirano, cacio e pepe from a restaurant right next to the station. Not bad! Certainly better than what I was expecting to eat near the station.</p>
<p>The view waiting for the train in Tirano. Not a bad view with the Alps in the background. But I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that things were no longer as pristine as they were in Switzerland.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/300776ac-8da1-4117-a18b-010278412646.jpg" alt="A railway station platform with a bench and a view of train cars covered in graffiti. In the background are residential buildings and snow-capped mountains under a cloudy sky."></p>
<p>My original ticket from Tirano to Milan was for 3pm. I&rsquo;m not sure why I left myself so much time (almost 4 hours) in Tirano. I guess I thought I&rsquo;d have a leisurely lunch? Well, I was ready to head out around 12:30, so I bought a ticket for the 1:00 train to Milan.</p>
<p>As the train neared Milan, it got pretty crowded. At least in my car, it seemed every seat was taken.</p>
<p>After about 2 and a half hours, we pulled into Milan and wow it&rsquo;s crowded. I&rsquo;ve to see a train station so bustling. I guess a lot of people are taking the train in Milan.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cdb3a5d6-1b3a-46fe-bab8-09b4fb4611b2.jpg" alt="Crowded train station with passengers waiting on the platform. An electric train with green and blue coloring is parked. The station features a high, arched glass roof and intricate architectural details on the wall. "></p>

Several people are walking, standing, and using escalators in the busy concourse. Signs with information and advertisements are visible throughout the scene. "></p>
<p>And that brings us to the present moment, here in my hotel room in Milan. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll sightsee, then on Sunday I head to Rome, which will mark the end of my solo train adventure. (Don&rsquo;t worry, my wife and I will still be using trains to get around Italy. But the motives change to practicality over train travel for the sake of train travel.)</p>
<p>Reflecting now on my time in Switzerland, wow was it incredible. Not just because of the trains (which were great), but all the natural beauty is what stands out. Seeing the Alps was amazing. The views from the Glacier Express were great, but honestly, being in Zermatt, seeing the Matterhorn, then taking the gondola up to 12,700 feet for even more insane views really takes the cake. What an amazing place. I&rsquo;m already thinking about when I can return, haha!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;ll have another update tomorrow with what I saw in Milan. Goodnight!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hello again from St. Moritz!</p>
<p>I decided to have a rather low key day today, the skies were mostly overcast and after so many days of either travel or activities, I was feeling the need to recover.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s a low key day in the Swiss Alps look like? How about a short train ride, followed by a gondola? Sure, why not.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c0b5473d-4527-44c2-ac84-5a550022add0.jpg" alt="A red passenger train stationed at a platform amidst a mountainous landscape with snow-capped peaks and a grassy area in the foreground."></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning that spring in St. Moritz, more so than Zermatt, is a very in-between season. Ski slopes and lifts are shut down. Summer activities largely don&rsquo;t open up until a few weeks into June. In fact, there&rsquo;s only one gondola and mountaintop open near St. Moritz: Diavolezza.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/684414eb-a2c4-4943-b5b4-3b2bd10decd3.jpg" alt="Snow-patched alpine landscape with a ski chairlift system and a partial view of a tunnel structure in the foreground. Cloudy skies suggest overcast weather."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/124cd525-bf43-44f6-8f63-42199421a909.jpg" alt="A mountain peak with some snow, against a cloudy sky, with the lower slopes covered in grass and some power lines visible in the foreground."></p>
<p>My view from the top.</p>

<p>Normally, the view from here includes several higher peaks, including Piz Bernina, which is the tallest peak in the eastern Alps. But, no such luck today. However, I do think parts of the glacier were visible when the clouds cooperated. I stayed for a bit to see if things would clear up some, but more clouds rolled in. It also snowed/sleeted very slightly. I was at about 10,000 ft of elevation and even with the clouds, it was a curious combination of being hot and cold at the same time. Cold because of the air, but hot because of what little bit of intense sun made it through the clouds.</p>
<p>So, I decided to head back down the mountain. Here&rsquo;s the view from the gondola on the way down.</p>

<p>My train back to St. Moritz pulling into the station.</p>

<p>From here, I returned to the hotel to have some tea and do some reading. I enjoyed the view of the lake and mountains while doing so.</p>
<p>Tonight, I&rsquo;ll have an early dinner at the hotel and an early night. Tomorrow, I have the Bernina Express which will travel through the Bernina Pass to Tirano, Italy. After a short stop there, I&rsquo;ll take a train to Milan.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s some interest in how I packed for this trip, so here&rsquo;s a post about that. (Hi, Su!)</p>
<p>I knew I needed to develop a packing strategy ahead of the trip so I could be away for about a month. I also had a few other goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a carry-on sized bag so I wouldn&rsquo;t need to check it and it&rsquo;d more easily be stowed on trains</li>
<li>Ideally a backpack so I&rsquo;m not lugging a roller down cobblestone streets or something like that. Plus it would be nice to have both hands free</li>
<li>Enough organization to keep clean and dirty clothes separated. Plus have my bag not turn into a sloppy nightmare after living out of it for a month. Since for a good portion of the trip I&rsquo;d be in the same spot for only 2 nights, repacking and staying organized should be easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in anticipation for this trip, I got a <a href="https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-42l-travel-pack">Cotopaxi Allpa 42L travel pack</a>.</p>
<p>What appealed to me about this is that it opens suitcase style and has some organization but not too much. So more pockets than a duffle bag, but not excessively compartmentalized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a backpack first and includes a hip belt, which has been great and I&rsquo;d highly recommend a hip belt for a bag this size.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/745b8e68-8fc9-4c51-aa18-f358aa7ea628.jpg" alt="An open suitcase on a bed with neatly organized clothes and a pair of shoes beside it. The suitcase contains various clothing items including shirts and pants, and utilizes packing cubes for organization."></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm organizing the bag:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main compartment
<ul>
<li>jackets and nicer shirts in the bottom of the main compartment folded simply to not be too thick</li>
<li>packing cubes on top of those
<ul>
<li>small packing cube (top): underwear and socks</li>
<li>large packing cube (bottom): pants, shorts, t-shirts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top left small compartment
<ul>
<li>packable day bag</li>
<li>travel towel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bottom left mid-size compartment
<ul>
<li>Beach stuff (bathing suits, beach shirts)</li>
<li>Extra shoes and sandals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>small compartment on the face of the bag (which is face down on the bed)
<ul>
<li>My dopp kit</li>
<li>Some small items like power adapters and battery</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything stowed.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/97ccd205-3cf9-45f0-a498-8bbb1eab9a64.jpg" alt="An open travel backpack with clothing items visible through their mesh tops, lying on a textured gray blanket with a yellow patterned sheet underneath."></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the bag all zipped up.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7b09ce09-556d-41dd-b82f-839050851fff.jpg" alt="A blue travel backpack with a silhouette of an alpaca on it, placed on a gray knitted blanket over a patterned sheet."></p>
<p>Packed like this it weighs 24.6 lbs.</p>
<p>While I got this bag in anticipation of this trip, I&rsquo;ve used it for some shorter trips earlier in the year as a trial run. So far, I&rsquo;m very happy with this bag. I&rsquo;ll probably continue to use it when I need something that doesn&rsquo;t need to be checked.</p>
<p>As far as clothing strategy, I wanted to go for a capsule wardrobe where any top can be worn with any bottom. I also chose merino wool t-shirts since I&rsquo;ve read they are good for travel, stay relatively clean (even after wearing for multiple days, but so far I haven&rsquo;t had to test this theory), and dry quickly (in the event you need to wash them in your hotel room).</p>
<p>My goal was to be able to go 7 days without doing laundry, so I have enough socks, underwear, and shirts to accomplish that. Ideally I&rsquo;d be able use hotel laundry service before I hit 7 days and I could avoid doing laundry in my room. So far, so good on this front. I&rsquo;ve used a coin-op laundry once and have my hotel doing laundry today.</p>
<p>So one challenge for my trip in particular, aside from the length, is the different climates I&rsquo;d be traveling through. From moderate, damp climates like London, cold mountain climates of Switzerland, and warm beach climates of Italy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a tally of what I packed in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x button up long sleeve shirts</li>
<li>1x button up short sleeve shirt</li>
<li>2x cotton t-shirts</li>
<li>5x merino short sleeve t-shirts</li>
<li>1x merino long sleeve shirt</li>
<li>1x exercise/hike shirt</li>
<li>1x lounge shorts</li>
<li>2x synthetic shorts</li>
<li>1x synthetic pants (wore the second pair on the plane)</li>
<li>7x pairs of socks (5x merino, 2x cotton)</li>
<li>7x underware</li>
<li>Rain jacket</li>
<li>Arcterix packable down jacket</li>
<li>2x hats</li>
<li>2x swim suits</li>
<li>2x beach shirts</li>
<li>Sandals</li>
<li>Extra sneakers (Lems)</li>
<li>packable backpack (Matador)</li>
<li>packable travel towel</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading this list out, I think I fit a lot in the bag without it feeling extremely over packed. (It does require some effort to close, though.)</p>
<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t want to put in the Allpa was any electronics or things (like medicine) I&rsquo;d want with me in the event my backpack was checked.</p>
<p>For this, I opted for this <a href="https://aersf.com/products/day-sling-3-x-pac">sling bag from Aer</a>. In here I packed:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad 10&quot; Air</li>
<li>Kobo ebook reader</li>
<li>Medicine</li>
<li>International power adapters</li>
<li>Phone/iPad charger and cords</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Print out of train tickets</li>
<li>Glasses and sunglasses</li>
</ul>
<p>This bag is just big enough to fit all the above!</p>
<p>So, about a week and a half in to the trip and so far I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with this setup! I think this has convinced me that carry-on backpack travel is the way to go!</p>
<p>Have you ever packed for a trip like this? How did you pack and how did it go? Let me know in the comments!</p>
<p>Update: I forgot to mention some clothing I purchased during my trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lightweight zip up fleece from North Face. I wanted another layer in Zermatt before going up to 12,000 feet and something that was more mid-weight than my down jacket.</li>
<li>A crushable Mont Bell hat. I‚Äôve been wanting more hats like this and found it in Zermatt.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two items easily fit in the backpack!</p>

			 <p>Hello from St. Moritz!</p>
<p>Today is all about the Glacier Express, a scenic train through the Swiss Alps between Zermatt and St. Moritz. This train is considered a bucket list item by many and has accolades aplenty. Will it live up to these expectations?</p>
<p>The exterior of the train is rather ordinary for Switzerland.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b683e97b-2db3-4d05-a705-b45963f7e3d7.jpg" alt="A red and white passenger train parked at a station platform with tactile paving on the ground."></p>
<p>But the interior, that&rsquo;s something incredible.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5cd5a101-202c-4711-92d2-fb0bf8db1ce6.jpg" alt="Interior of a luxury passenger train with spacious seating, large panoramic windows, and a scenic view of green, forested hills and a small town."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ed741b37-95ec-4a19-abf3-91d79cc077a7.jpg" alt="A train bar carriage with a compass rose on the ceiling, a counter with bottles, and a window showing another train outside."></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m riding in what they call the Excellence Class. Here, every seat is at these picture windows with a table. You are served a six course meal with wine pairing as the trip progresses. It&rsquo;s excessively luxurious, but this is likely a once in a lifetime thing, so I thought it was worth the splurge.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0975b00a-a956-40e5-b3b2-49e0c96c915f.jpg" alt="A magazine cover titled &ldquo;EXCELLENCE MAGAZINE&rdquo; featuring a photograph of a stone bridge with a train crossing, with the caption &ldquo;Window to the Swiss Alps&rdquo; and the Glacier Express logo, indicating routes from St. Moritz/Davos - Zermatt."></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few facts and figures from the Excellence Magazine that was provided to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Jungfrau-Aletsch and Albula &amp; Bernini Line</li>
<li>Route length: 291 kilometers</li>
<li>291 bridges</li>
<li>42 km/h avg speed</li>
<li>From 584 to 2,033 meters above sea level</li>
<li>45 m^2 windows in each carriage</li>
<li>91 tunnels</li>
<li>In operation since 1930</li>
<li>Steepest gradient: 12.5%</li>
<li>31.9km cog wheel stretch</li>
</ul>
<p>But forget the numbers, let&rsquo;s talk about the views. The landscapes quickly became impressive. A lot of the advertising shows this train in winter, but I&rsquo;m glad that I was able to take it in the spring, as the green fields with wildflowers against the snow capped mountains made for stunning view after stunning view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry that these photos do not do it justice. You&rsquo;ll have to take my word for it. Or, better yet, come and experience the Glacier Express for yourself!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/80138c45-e13e-46f4-94c7-43b69fe70637.jpg" alt="A vibrant field of yellow flowers with a backdrop of towering mountains and a clear blue sky, taken from behind a window as evidenced by light reflections visible across the image."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ba699524-0d8d-4275-aa59-7dc9235efadb.jpg" alt="A picturesque view of a mountainous village with snow-capped peaks in the background, green hills in the foreground, buildings scattered throughout, and a clear sky above."></p>
<p>Here we have one of the first highlight landscapes: The Oberalp Pass, which is 2,033 meters above sea level. Here you see the Oberalp Lake.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/99994c68-eadc-47cd-851b-78707d1e2981.jpg" alt="A glacier with a snow-covered surface featuring meltwater pools against a backdrop of mountain slopes and a clear blue sky."></p>
<p>Near the pass is, surprisingly enough, this lighthouse. This lighthouse marks the source (well, one of) the Rhine river. It&rsquo;s a smaller scale exact copy of the lighthouse in Rotterdam where the Rhine meets the sea!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/73ae1744-887f-48c4-ac15-00cb760a2bf3.jpg" alt="A red-roofed lighthouse-style building labeled &ldquo;Infocenter&rdquo; perched on a snow-covered landscape with mountainous terrain in the background."></p>
<p>When I booked this trip, I did not expect to see the origin of these famous rivers. In Lyon, the Rh√¥ne river passes through the city. The train route from Lyon to Geneva to Brig follows the Rh√¥ne river valley and we saw the headwaters of this river as well. So incredible! Not to mention the milky blue color of the water, which my train neighbor told me is due to the glacial melt water mixed with the mineral content of the mountains.</p>
<p>The next highlight is the Rhine Gorge, which we are told is known as the &ldquo;Swiss Grand Canyon.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure about that comparison, but it was an incredible sight that stood out from the other landscapes. This photo really doesn&rsquo;t do it justice.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3904f4a7-b24f-4829-9700-494b89e31941.jpg" alt="A serene landscape featuring a turquoise river in the foreground with lush greenery on its banks and dramatic, rocky mountains in the background, all under a slightly cloudy sky."></p>
<p>We had a short stop at a station to switch out engines. So, I took an opportunity to photograph engine 626.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/19360b09-2887-4693-bc00-9eb6d602a61a.jpg" alt="A red train locomotive with the number 626 parked at a train station, with mountains and a cloudy sky in the background."></p>
<p>A few more scenic village views before our next highlight.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9e87e2a0-56b0-4460-bbfd-da710c0acdec.jpg" alt="A serene landscape with a small church on a hill, plowed fields in the foreground, and snow-capped mountains in the background."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cefa65a8-11fe-4168-be22-c77d8aa9369b.jpg" alt="A picturesque village nestled at the base of a mountain range with a prominent peak against a blue sky with fluffy clouds. A road winds through vibrant green fields leading towards the village center, characterized by traditional buildings and a church with a tall steeple."></p>
<p>The final highlight on the trip is the Landwasser Viaduct. It was built in 1902 and stands 65 meters tall. It is considered an architectural masterpiece. Again, the photos do not do it justice and, honestly, the best views would have been from outside the train rather than on it. But I do think it was cool that we could catch a glimpse of the forward carriages of our train as we made the crossing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/42079c52-81df-4703-8d2a-3b0f0960c159.jpg" alt="A train crossing a tall, stone arch bridge against a backdrop of steep, rocky slopes and trees under a partly cloudy sky."></p>
<p>Not too long after the viaduct, we pulled into the platform at St. Moritz.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/01255c6f-a672-448c-b37c-1994d27e8f24.jpg" alt="A red and white electric train at a platform with overhead power lines, a pantograph raised to connect with the electric supply, and other trains in the background."></p>
<p>Thank you, Glacier Express, for an incredible experience! So, does it live up to the hype? Yes, I think so. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever experience anything quite like this anywhere else. The views were amazing. The train interior was over the top luxury. The service was great. The food, hands down the best I&rsquo;ve ever had on a mode of transportation. It was certainly high-end restaurant level of food. And the wine pairings (all Swiss wines, I believe) were very good as well.</p>
<p>The view in St. Moritz immediately outside the train station.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/47e152f0-9755-4a72-9d68-5d1fc276646b.jpg" alt="A scenic view of a lake with a town in the foreground and snow-capped mountains in the background under a blue sky with clouds."></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the view from my room. It&rsquo;s perfectly on theme for this whole trip and somewhat accidental, as I didn&rsquo;t realize it overlooked the station.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/8a6c0442-c74e-4044-83a2-cb918809540a.jpg" alt="A train station with red trains, a lake, a forest, and snow-capped mountains in the background."></p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll explore St. Moritz! I believe there&rsquo;s a cog railway up the mountain that I&rsquo;ll most likely visit.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>Hello from Zermatt, Switzerland! Today was all about the mountains.</p>
<p>I spent the morning with breakfast at the hotel (another enjoyable buffet!) and some wandering around town. I was waiting for the sky to clear before I headed up into the mountains.</p>
<p>When I saw this, the Matterhorn, emerge from the clouds, I knew it was time.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bedc334a-daed-47ba-8489-d2d115d50c49.jpg" alt="Snow-covered mountain peak against a blue sky, with evergreen trees in the foreground."></p>
<p>I headed to the back of town where the gondola base station is location. Our destination: the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. I hopped on the first gondola and began the ascent. Pretty quickly we were approaching the tree line.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/777fe3c2-91ef-4323-af2e-a2f129544bee.jpg" alt="Mountainous landscape with a winding road, snow patches, rocky terrain, and a blue sky with clouds."></p>
<p>After a total of 3 separate gondolas, I was at the top! I immediately went to the viewing platform and it was incredible! The sky was clear, any clouds still hanging about, we were above them!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ceb86eb9-f5ac-4bc9-83b7-ca549d00dbbd.jpg" alt="Snow-covered mountain peaks with clouds nestled in the valleys, under a clear blue sky."></p>
<p>And the Matterhorn looks stunning! From up here you see a different face of the mountain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a7f52bdc-ae06-4c85-b7f1-27d21525de4a.jpg" alt="A snow-covered mountain peak with clear blue skies in the background. Ski tracks and ski lifts are visible on the lower slopes."></p>
<p>I think this shot is of the highest peak visible from this location. I believe it&rsquo;s over 4,500m (~14,700ft). The Matterhorn clocks in around 4,400m.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/54467f5c-6f35-460f-8283-c9a8a492223b.jpg" alt="Aerial view of snow-capped mountains piercing through a blanket of clouds under a clear blue sky."></p>
<p>Yours truly posing with the Matterhorn in the background. I didn&rsquo;t build the snowman.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bb7e9eaa-1c16-4629-bf77-196e4077af43.jpg" alt="A man with a beard wearing a black jacket and a yellow hat stands smiling in front of a snow-covered mountain range under a clear blue sky."></p>
<p>From this platform we are at 3883m (12,739ft) of elevation, which is the highest mountain platform in Europe.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/84abafa1-c7ab-4ee4-9e22-b6fde15d9915.jpg" alt="A smartwatch on a wrist displaying the incline, elevation, and GPS coordinates against a snowy mountain backdrop. It shows an elevation of ~12,742 ft. "></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few more photos from the viewing platform. It&rsquo;s really stunning to be so high up and seeing these incredible mountains. One bit of info that I thought was fun is this location is very close to the Italian border. There&rsquo;s a gondola that can take you down on the Italian side. I believe you can also walk or ski over the border. I was so close that my phone must have connected to an Italian cell tower because I got a &ldquo;Welcome to Italy&rdquo; text from Verizon to tell me about my travel pass. Also, the cell service was, somehow, incredible up here.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/870598dc-8a93-48a8-9400-372f9efb5032.jpg" alt="A snow-covered mountain peak under a clear blue sky with surrounding alpine scenery."></p>

<p>Next, I went inside the building (which is really more like tunnels carved into the mountain) to check out the glacier palace, complete with ice sculptures.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ec87b603-b09c-4d1d-9ea2-384c45563319.jpg" alt="A walkway through an ice tunnel with blue flooring, handrails on the sides, and walls and ceiling of curved, smooth ice."></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s even a restaurant up here! So I grabbed a bite. I had a dish that was bread covered in mushrooms in sauce topped with cheese. The whole plate was stuck under the broiler to melt the cheese. Then it was topped with a fried egg. Not bad!</p>
<p>Before I made my way down, I went back to the viewing platform one more time. I snapped this photo of the tower next to the platform. This must be why the cell signal is so great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a22210f7-05dd-4693-bb74-5962eea2143b.jpg" alt="A snow-covered communication tower with numerous stickers on it, set against a clear blue sky with the sun peeking out, surrounded by a snowy mountainous landscape."></p>

<p>On the way down, I exited at the last gondola station so I could take the walking path back to town. I had maybe 1,000ft of descent left, and this path looked nice on the way up. I&rsquo;m very glad I did, because I think this was one of the most beautiful walks in my life.</p>

<p>And then, a final reward, one more incredible view of the Matterhorn.</p>

<p>Finally, pasted the gondola station where my ascent began.</p>

<p>Today has been amazing. Zermatt is an incredible place. It&rsquo;s certainly one of the most scenic places I&rsquo;ve ever traveled to.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I depart to St. Moritz on the Glacier Express! If this train is even a fraction of its reputation, I think it will be incredible.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>Hello from Zermatt, Switzerland!</p>
<p>Today was one of the most complicated days of travel as I had multiple connections. But everything went smoothly and felt rather relaxed overall.</p>
<p>First up, my train from Lyon to Geneva, Switzerland. It&rsquo;s a regional train that made multiple stops along the way.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1756d9c9-70ee-499c-bf96-26b1752043ec.jpg" alt="A regional train with &ldquo;La R√©gion Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes&rdquo; on its side, parked at a station platform."></p>
<p>My first class cabin.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6d598114-e13f-4614-bd5e-7eac878cb49e.jpg" alt="Interior of a train carriage with empty seats, patterned divider, overhead luggage compartments, and passengers seated further down."></p>
<p>After about 2 hours, I arrived in Geneva! Switzerland is not in the EU, so there&rsquo;s technically a border crossing between France and here. I did see the border/customs while exiting the platform, but they weren&rsquo;t stopping anyone to check passports or scan bags.</p>
<p>I had about an hour here, which was more than enough time to have lunch and coffee and do a small bit of sightseeing just outside the station.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c37f7c01-ccb9-497c-b53c-ade6a7b4bfaa.jpg" alt="Indoor corridor in a modern building with people walking, shops on the right, decorative wood paneling on the ceiling, glass facade on the left, and hanging clocks."></p>
<p>Gotta love the bike parking!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a0ff683a-9e72-4f60-8d19-ad5ec0b3d8cd.jpg" alt="Red double-decker bus parked beside a crowded bicycle rack, with apartment buildings in the background and street art on a building wall."></p>
<p>Next was a Swiss regional train headed to Brig, but I&rsquo;d be transferring at Visp.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f64bc6f9-3cbf-411a-b680-c6fe73d96fdc.jpg" alt="A red and white train at a station platform with overhead electrical lines and a blue commuter train visible in the background."></p>
<p>Another first class cabin. Nothing too special, but totally comfortable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dd1aff60-eb51-4ab7-9e76-a5f54f393feb.jpg" alt="Interior of a modern train carriage with red and grey upholstery, overhead storage, and large windows. A television screen shows an advertisement. Passengers are by the door, and a worker is visible through the window."></p>
<p>As we rose further into the Alps, the landscapes became more dramatic. There&rsquo;s some very beautiful looking towns on the way from Geneva to Visp. Looking at the map, I realized I&rsquo;m following the Rh√¥ne river all the way from Lyon to Visp. The river valley in the Alps makes for some great scenery.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a315ecf3-0d98-40f9-8393-695a1aaca397.jpg" alt="A scenic view of agricultural fields under a cloudy sky, with raindrops visible on the surface from which the photo is taken, suggesting it was shot through a window."></p>

Low clouds or mist partly envelop the lower section of the mountains, and an electricity pylon stands on the right side"></p>
<p>At Visp, I had a short stop to transfer to the train destined for Zermatt, which is the end of the line.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/878c5bce-84d7-46d4-b0ba-fd65aae83bb4.jpg" alt="A red and white train at a platform with mountains in the background and a partly cloudy sky above."></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s steep enough in sections that there are cogs between the tracks. I have no idea if my train uses these, but interesting to see nonetheless.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/15bca72a-3184-40a2-bf58-9f5d5987e7dc.jpg" alt="View from a train window showing train tracks with cogs and lush green trees in the background."></p>
<p>In about an hour, I&rsquo;ve arrived in Zermatt and, wow, is it beautiful! It&rsquo;s a million chalets, sporting shops, a river, and mountains. Zermatt is essentially car free. Tourists must park in one town lower in the valley and take the train up.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5b65888a-d22b-451f-b072-263caddf0d43.jpg" alt="Tourists with luggage walking down a street lined with Swiss chalet-style buildings and shops, including a Rolex store, with mountains in the background."></p>
<p>At 5,276 ft (1,608 m) of elevation, we are certainly up in the mountains!</p>

<p>Just steps from where I&rsquo;m staying.</p>

<p>The view from the small balcony on my room, incredible!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all from me today. I&rsquo;m hoping to have an early dinner and an early night so I can clock a full 8 hours. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ve booked a gondola to take me up to one of the highest gondola accessible points in Europe. There should be views of the Matterhorn and many other peaks.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s how I spent my lazy Sunday in Lyon.</p>
<p>A late breakfast at the hotel (I tend to really love European breakfast buffets and this one was no exception) then I headed back to Vieux Lyon to see a movie and miniatures museum I noticed yesterday.</p>
<p>Soon after walking in the door, I was greeted with this and knew it&rsquo;d be a place I&rsquo;d enjoy:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/d4491432-2c33-46b8-92a0-c45818ce8c9f.jpg" alt="A life-size model of a Triceratops head in a lush garden with plants, positioned in front of an arched doorway draped with a curtain."></p>
<p>They had a whole room of Ghostbusters paraphernalia. This is a childhood favorite franchise of mine. They had a case of vintage toys and I spotted a few I had as a kid.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3393a5de-2452-494c-9ae7-3d9391165c9e.jpg" alt="A Ghostbusters-themed display featuring a Proton Pack, ghost traps, a PKE Meter, lockers with jumpsuits, and themed collectibles."></p>
<p>One of my favorite exhibits was on movie posters by the artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Struzan">Drew Struzan</a>. I was definitely familiar with his work, but never knew about the artist behind these posters.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/07566e01-a4de-4f0c-aec1-c98dc75f6e91.jpg" alt="Three large posters depicting characters and spacecraft from the Star Wars franchise displayed on a black wall beneath wooden beams, with spotlights shining on them."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c610e186-9a85-46d8-be81-af98db1bf584.jpg" alt="Three framed movie posters depicting the original Indiana Jones films, displayed in an exhibition with spot lighting and wooden beams in the background."></p>
<p>The miniature displays were something to see. So many small, painstaking details. I really liked the interior of this vintage New York subway car.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6873aa2b-2ff4-4e39-b95d-59579f8c2cec.jpg" alt="Interior of an empty subway car with benches, handrails, advertisements, and overhead lighting."></p>
<p>Next, I decided to take a river boat cruise along the Sa√¥ne river.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a371e7a2-aaff-44ea-8640-8bf4e07fe44b.jpg" alt="A river with a tour boat, people sitting on the quay, and a backdrop of European-style buildings under a cloudy sky."></p>
<p>It was very relaxing. One aspect I enjoyed was seeing the contrasting architecture of the Renaissance era buildings of Vieux Lyon with the modern architecture of the Confluence district (so called because it&rsquo;s the confluence of the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne rivers).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/401f954c-82fa-41e1-b2b9-ea663cf2d3c3.jpg" alt="A river in the foreground with a pedestrian bridge to the left. Colorful buildings line the riverbank, backed by a hill with greenery and a large building on top. A tower is visible behind the hill."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c3d38aec-f9ee-4939-9a85-968ebc2cf38c.jpg" alt="The image shows a riverside view with modern buildings, including a distinctive orange building with a unique perforated facade and a spiral staircase on its exterior. Behind it is a building with an intricate geometric glass structure on its top. There are boats moored. "></p>
<p>After the boat, I had an ice cream Sunday for lunch. There was a place that every time I&rsquo;ve walked past it&rsquo;s had a giant line. Today was no exception. But I saw they had an area with some tables and waiter service that somehow had no wait. So that&rsquo;s where I went.</p>
<p>After this, I rented an e-bike. I&rsquo;ve seen so many people on bikes both in Paris and here, I definitely wanted to experience it for myself. Speaking of the Confluence, I decided to head back to that area on bike and explore the bike paths along the rivers a little more.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0e7719ad-a86e-41d9-abab-b9409d233473.jpg" alt="A bicycle parked on a grassy riverbank with personal belongings scattered nearby and people walking in the background. In the background, the confluence of the Sa√¥ne and Rh√¥ne rivers"></p>
<p>A quick break at the hotel and I ventured back into Vieux Lyon for dinner. I keep returning to this neighborhood for a few reasons. One, it&rsquo;s super charming and I love the Renaissance era streets and buildings. Two, it&rsquo;s a short (and beautiful) walk from my hotel. I learned on the boat tour that Vieux Lyon is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the largest remaining districts of Renaissance buildings.</p>
<p>Another quick aside on language. I&rsquo;m surprised how many little bits of French I understand. (When written! Spoken, I have no clue.) It&rsquo;s mostly food related terms that I&rsquo;ve learned from restaurants in the US. Sometimes, the French description of food is more illuminating to me than the English description. For instance, my meal last night was described as sausage, but in French it was boudin noir (which I know to be a type of blood sausage). Tonight, I had steak with &ldquo;pepper sauce&rdquo;. In French, it was sauce au poivre, which I&rsquo;ve even cooked myself sonI knew exactly what to expect. There&rsquo;s also other non-food related terms that have entered the English language from French, so there&rsquo;s no translation needed. Like &ldquo;confluence&rdquo;!</p>
<p>After dinner, it was back to the hotel to get some sleep. It&rsquo;s another early day tomorrow. I&rsquo;m headed to Zermatt, Switzerland via Geneva. It&rsquo;ll be a long day on multiple trains, but it should be fairly relaxed, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>Hello from Lyon!</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s train was Ouigo Grande Vitesse train No 7885 operating on the high speed line between Paris and Lyon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e362f205-9a56-46bc-9866-c9d1d3ba61a8.jpg" alt="High-speed passenger train at a station platform with people walking by."></p>

<p>This is my second high speed line after the Eurostar to Paris. I only wish this train was in an orange livery like the original TGVs. Instead I got this&hellip;interesting color choice. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve fulfilled the goal of riding the high speed line that caught my attention as a child!</p>
<p>What was exciting, new, and futuristic around 40 years ago now just seems ordinary here. The train lives up to its high speed lineage. The cars themselves were nothing special, I&rsquo;d say.  Double decker, luggage racks, bathrooms, a mix of seats with tables and without. Roughly similar to what I&rsquo;m familiar with in the northeast of the US. Definitely comfortable and roomy compared to a plane. But Eurostar is taking the cake in terms of fit and finish and service. Of course, I chose this leg based on schedule and speed. I could have taken an earlier or later train that had more amenities. But honestly, it&rsquo;s such a short trip I didn&rsquo;t really miss them.</p>
<p>Plus, the scenery passing by was beautiful. It felt like an animated Windows XP wallpaper, only better looking.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c28edaaf-c8ae-43d4-beb6-9f761bf6c817.jpg" alt="A lush green field under a partly cloudy sky, with a utility pole bearing signs in the foreground, and distant buildings on the horizon."></p>
<p>Pretty quickly we were pulling in to Lyon. My train went on to other stops beyond this, so it was only in the station for a few minutes. This particular route stopped at the station near the Lyon airport. And wow, I really loved the architecture of the station.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b78f81fa-c58a-4ac5-8299-b900f1275ba0.jpg" alt="A double-decker train branded &ldquo;OUIGO&rdquo; at a modern station with an arched concrete canopy and clear skies."></p>

<p>Because I was at the airport, I needed to take light rail into the city center.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/70ff668a-e766-4856-abb4-ea5a55a69aae.jpg" alt="View from inside a train with a window sticker reminding passengers to collect their luggage, featuring the logo &ldquo;Vigipirate,&rdquo; the French national security alert system. Beyond the window are train tracks, green fields, and a blue sky with clouds."></p>
<p>After this, I took a street tram further into the city toward my hotel. A short walk later and I&rsquo;m at my hotel. I&rsquo;m staying at Hotel Globe et Cecil which is charming and centrally located.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ed61cb66-bedb-4185-a1a4-877a66a415e5.jpg" alt="A wide river flanked by embankments with walking paths, trees, and buildings under a clear sky with scattered clouds. A distinctive building with a dome is on the left."></p>
<p>Because of the length of my trip and the limited packing space I have (if you have interest in how I packed for this trip, let me know and I can post about it!), I needed to get some laundry done. I thought my hotel had laundry service, but turns out they do, just not on weekends. So I decided to try a coin op. Can you believe this is my walk to the laundromat, which is in Vieux Lyon (the old city):</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0daa2825-3bca-48c1-bd07-2289da2adc40.jpg" alt="A narrow city street lined with a mix of modern and traditional buildings, featuring cobblestone pavement with rectangular bollards, under a partly cloudy sky.

<p>I returned later to Vieux Lyon for dinner at a bouchon (a restaurant serving classic French dishes). I had a boudin noir and apple pie which I really enjoyed. Dessert was a dish called √Æle flottante which means floating island. I needed to look this one up before ordering, I&rsquo;ve never heard of the dish in English or French. It&rsquo;s a block of meringue floating in a pool of cr√®me anglaise. It&rsquo;s really great!</p>

<p>After dinner, I walked a little out of the way around Vieux Lyon to take in the scenery at night.</p>

			 <p>Hello! A shorter update tonight because it&rsquo;s late and I have an earlyish day tomorrow.</p>
<p>The main event of today was visiting the Louvre. It was incredible! I knew it was supposed to be great, but I really had no idea how great. What an amazing museum. I could probably write for an hour about what I saw and I barely scratched the surface of what the museum has on display.

<p>And I the then building itself is art, I mean look at this place!</p>

<p>Of course, the art on display is amazing as well.</p>

<p>I bought the self guided audio tour and was amused the device is a Nintendo 3DS. I have many questions about how this came to be. But it worked surprisingly well!</p>

"></p>
<p>After the Louvre, I strolled along the Seine until I reached the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b64af9e0-c28e-44d2-b861-526ee2fefae8.jpg" alt="The Eiffel Tower stands tall against a blue sky with clouds, surrounded by green foliage. A person is visible at the bottom right corner, appearing small in comparison to the towering structure."></p>
<p>After that, I took the metro&ndash;a quaint older tram/train/not sure what to call it with rubber wheels that ran along an elevated track&ndash;to the Montmartre neighborhood for dinner.</p>

<p>The views on the way back from dinner were great.

			 <p>Welcome back to another update from my <a href="https://doug.pub/2024/05/18/europe-train-adventure.html">Europe Train Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>Today was the first high speed rail leg of my trip, starting at St. Pancras International station in London and arriving at Gare du Nord in Paris.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/8d91292d-7560-49b6-87f6-cc13c1b2d7aa.jpg" alt="A person walking through an arched corridor with the sign &ldquo;St Pancras International&rdquo; on a brick wall, indicating a location within St Pancras railway station."></p>
<p>I enjoyed the architecture of St. Pancras station as I headed to board Eurostar 9022 to Paris.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e35edab4-c7de-4fa8-9c61-523ccaee21c5.jpg" alt="A busy train station with a large clock, passengers with luggage, a departing train, and a glass and metal roof structure."></p>

<p>My car for the journey. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious. I also appreciated how low key the boarding experience was. I was relaxing in my seat and without any fanfare we slowly started to depart the station.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7494c123-103c-48c4-9562-2f690c1159b3.jpg" alt="Interior of a train carriage with passengers seated and overhead luggage compartments, featuring comfortable seats and a digital display indicating the destination as Paris."></p>
<p>The high speed rail lived up to its name! That&rsquo;s about 182 mph.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/716aa7ef-9aeb-4f46-84ed-cbd749147cc0.jpg" alt="A digital display inside a train showing the speed of 293 km/h and the destination &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; under the label &ldquo;Business Premier.""></p>
<p>The trip felt quick too. We were practically to Paris by the time I was able to upload a photo and make a short post. My seat included food, which was served before we even entered the Chunnel.</p>
<p>The platform in Gare du Nord station.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1b5eb672-a9ad-4e8d-9457-6e7d873f0912.jpg" alt="The Gare du Nord train station interior with platforms, tracks, passengers with luggage, overhead signs for platforms 3 and 4, a stairway, and a glass and metal roof."></p>
<p>The station exterior from the street.

<p>My hotel is only a short walk from Gare du Nord. After checking in to my room, I decided to stroll around and I ended up walking along Canal Saint Martin.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/43da869c-3ef7-412c-80c5-7b0ad2e390b9.jpg" alt="A scenic view of a canal with clear water, bordered by a pedestrian walkway and a road with a few cars and cyclists. Trees and buildings line the opposite bank under a cloudy sky."></p>
<p>Something I noticed while walking around Paris is how many bikes there are and the numerous bike lanes and associated bike infrastructure. Many lanes on busier streets seemed protected from car traffic, which is great. Other European cities, such as Amsterdam, are famous for their biking, but I didn&rsquo;t realize Paris was this far along. I wish US cities would adopt this kind of bike infrastructure. There&rsquo;s an increasing number of people riding bikes in Atlanta, but we are especially far behind when it comes to bike infra!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll do some sightseeing around Paris. Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>Today was spent mostly at the Tower of London, which I really enjoyed. It&rsquo;s incredible to see the structures built over the ages, including nearly 2000 year old remains from the Romans as well as many towers and keeps from the 1200s to relatively recent Tudor era timber framed buildings.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6fab77bc-0a5a-4b25-b95b-deea614a8615.jpg" alt="The Tower of London, a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London, with its distinctive white buildings and four turreted towers."></p>
<p>Here, the White Tower is the central keep of the fortress and is nearly 1000 years old!
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/eb1cce4b-26b9-493f-bacd-d08cf1fc9cc2.jpg" alt="The White Tower, the central keep of the Tower of London, under an overcast sky with visitors walking around its base."></p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s house (note the royal guard) is an example of the Tudor style.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/39f278b1-68f0-48a6-9413-cf2c117c271f.jpg" alt="The Queen‚Äôs house among other traditional English Tudor-style buildings with white and black timber framing, surrounding a green lawn with a tree to the right. There is a person standing by the entrance of the central building."></p>
<p>The Tower of London also serves as a reminder of England&rsquo;s often brutal past, as this location served as a prison, torture dungeon, and a place for executions.</p>
<p>Here a memorial marks the site of several executions, most famously that of Anne Boleyn.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/27f63732-36c7-47bb-9018-c6ec5f406c8d.jpg" alt="A glass memorial plaque on wet ground surrounded by a metal railing with raindrops and flowers laid on top, inscribed with text commemorating the execution site of historical figures, including Anne Boleyn. "></p>
<p>One thing that struck me in several of the keeps used as prisons was the inscriptions left in the walls by prisoners over the years. They were numerous and, at times, elaborate.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b4047cfd-52dc-49c8-b415-535948b4b68f.jpg" alt="A historic stone wall with inscriptions and a plaque detailing information about John Ballard, who was imprisoned and executed in 1586. The plaque mentions that Ballard was involved in the Babington Plot against Queen Elizabeth I."></p>
<p>Here you can see Traitor&rsquo;s Gate which was a water entrance off of the River Thames, so called because it was a commonly used entrance for prisoner barges.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/31325050-8fbb-4e34-a841-d5361a159e66.jpg" alt="Stone bridge arch with a black lattice gate partially submerged in water, reflecting in the water below. A plaque reads &ldquo;Traitors' Gate.""></p>
<p>The Tower is also home to the Crown Jewels (no photos allowed in here, folks!), including the current crown worn by King Charles. Curious that they are kept in a place with such a dark history.</p>
<p>The Tower grounds are also home to several ravens which are tended to by the official Ravenmaster. (Best title ever?) The legend goes, the kingdom and Tower of London will fall if the ravens ever leave.

<p>Next, I walked over the Tower Bridge and headed along the Thames towards Borough Market.</p>

<p>I ended my day out taking the train back to the <a href="https://doug.pub/2024/05/21/travel-report-arriving.html">Bull and Last</a>. You&rsquo;ve heard of the London Underground, but did you know there&rsquo;s an Overground?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c46cc7ad-093b-43c7-8b72-8411c78228c3.jpg" alt="A yellow and blue Overground train, numbered 378 214, at a platform with apartment buildings in the background."></p>
<p>Since the weather cleared, I took the long way back through Hampstead Heath and enjoyed the moody sunset.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, it&rsquo;s the Eurostar to Paris! Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>My flight touched down at Heathrow airport early this morning (before 7am).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9ca32333-38be-4a8c-b4ab-81015c90906f.jpg" alt="View from an airplane window showing the engine and wing over a seascape of clouds under a blue sky."></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t check a bag, so getting through the border and exiting the airport was a breeze.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f929b169-7a5f-4e15-98cc-ba9e17ef1750.jpg" alt="A subway station on the Elizabeth line from the airport. Interior of a modern subway station with curved walls and ceiling, featuring a reflective surface on one side and a tiled flooring leading to platform gates where people are standing and walking. One individual is noticeable in the foreground pulling a red suitcase."></p>
<p>I decided to take the train to get from the airport to the neighborhood where I&rsquo;d be staying (how could I not??). I took the Elizabeth line from the airport and transferred to the northern line on the Tube.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying in London at The Bull and Last a pub and inn right next to Hampstead Heath park in the NW5. A real pub is something I wanted to experience while in London, so why not stay at one! But seriously, I think it&rsquo;s great how they&rsquo;ve remodeled this old pub and brought it back as an active inn.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2de2e957-e249-442e-b91f-0f1248f4c1bd.jpg" alt="A traditional brick building housing &ldquo;The Bull and Last&rdquo; pub with a black facade, large windows, hanging plants, and road signs visible on a cloudy day."></p>
<p>My limited touring around today (lack of sleep on the plane got me&ndash;the flight was comfortable, a 5pm departure was just too early for me to fall asleep) involved walking through part of Hampstead Heath. I quickly learned this part of London is very dog friendly (which makes me like it even more). There were tons of dogs in the park, many off leash. Even better, there were lots of dogs in the cafe I visited this morning and in the pub.</p>
<p>Another creature that&rsquo;s abundant here: snails. Not sure if all of London is like this or it&rsquo;s just this neighborhood. üêå</p>
<p>Before dinner, I wanted to try and see a little more, so I headed out toward the Barbican where I hoped to see the conservatory. Unfortunately that was closed but I checked out a gallery and the surrounding area.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bf0929b6-f508-42c4-a905-552b49340f71.jpg" alt="A fountain in a pond, surrounded by brick pavement with brutalist architecture and modern buildings in the background, under a rainy sky."></p>
<p>Then back to The Bull and Last for dinner, which was good. I ordered a tomato salad and the BBQ cod which I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is more sightseeing before I take the Eurostar to Paris on Thursday.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t talked about this much here, but in March <a href="https://dougie.space/blog/end-of-an-era">I left my job</a> with the intention of taking some extended time off. Travel is one of the things that I want to do during my time off. And my first big trip is coming up this week:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be traveling from London to Rome via train!</p>
<p>The trip is structured so I&rsquo;ll have 2 nights in each city along the way, which I hope will give me a chance to have a break and do some sightseeing in-between travel days (plus a buffer if there should be an issue with one of the trains).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my itinerary:</p>
<ul>
<li>London</li>
<li>Eurostar to Paris</li>
<li>TGV to Lyon</li>
<li>SNCF regional to Geneva; Swiss regional to Zermatt</li>
<li>Glacier Express to St. Moritz</li>
<li>Bernina Express to Tirano, Italy; Trenord to Milan</li>
<li>Trenitalia to Rome</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oddly, Google Maps won&rsquo;t let you enter a multi-stop public transit trip, so I had to enter this as a car journey. It&rsquo;ll be roughly correct. (You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d support this for train transit!)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of train highlights for me on this trip. First up is the TGV (<em>Train √† Grande Vitesse</em>, &ldquo;high-speed train&rdquo;) from Paris to Lyon.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Somehow as a child, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2021/sep/15/france-high-speed-tgv-train-enters-service-1981">the image of these orange</a>, high speed trains got filed in my brain as very cool and futuristic. Although the Eurostar will be the first high speed train on this journey, I&rsquo;m most looking forward to this orange beast. As an adult, I&rsquo;ve been upset and jealous that the US doesn&rsquo;t have anything of the sort! So, I&rsquo;m excited to finally be experiencing world-class high speed rail.</p>
<p>The next highlight is the Glacier Express which is a scenic train through the Swiss Alps.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This should be the star of the show. I&rsquo;m spoiling myself by booking an Excellence Class ticket that includes fine dining and wine at your seat next to giant picture windows. I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but great things about this particular train and its incredible journey through the Alps. I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
<p>The Glacier Express terminates in St. Moritz where I&rsquo;ll take the Bernina Express to finish my pass through the Alps and transit into Italy via Tirano. Two nights in Milan is followed by Italian high speed rail down to Rome, where I&rsquo;ll link up with my wife.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of firsts for me in this trip: every country on the itinerary, high speed rail, and an extended solo journey. I&rsquo;ve traveled solo for work and conferences in the past, but never on vacation. So, this will be a true adventure for me. I&rsquo;m mostly excited, but also a little anxious.</p>
<p>In Rome, I&rsquo;ll meet up with my wife, who&rsquo;s traveling separately after a trip with her sister. From there, we&rsquo;ll spend the next two weeks together traveling in Italy. In addition to Rome, we have Florence, Tuscany, and Puglia (via Bari) on our Italian itinerary.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to follow along with my journey, I plan to post updates as I go right here on this site. If email is your thing, I&rsquo;ve turned on this site&rsquo;s newsletter feature (<a href="https://doug.pub/subscribe/">subscribe here</a>) so you can these posts right in your inbox.</p>
<p>The journey begins this week on May 20 when I take the overnight flight from Atlanta to London. Thanks for reading! Next update from London!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/emulators-will-change-the-app-store-forever">Emulators Will Change the App Store Forever - Wavelengths</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The introduction of emulators offers an alternative within this ecosystem, providing games with immersive stories and gameplay systems that are designed for extended play sessions. These games, though designed for other hardware, still offer complete¬†experiences counter to the endless treadmills of most apps found in the Games tab today which funnel users into shops loaded with in-game currencies. As the concept of emulation becomes more prevalent and ubiquitous across all¬†mobile devices, I feel as though it can introduce a much-needed shake-up to the MTX-laden landscape we live in today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like many people, I&rsquo;m excited to see Delta and other video game console emulators come to the App Store. It&rsquo;s been fun to get Pok√©mon and other classics running on my phone. These games appeal to me while most mobile games do not. So much so that I ordered my first iPhone <a href="https://www.gamesir.hk/collections/gamepads/products/gamesir-x2s">controller grip</a>.</p>
<p>However, what&rsquo;s been a sad thought is that the library of retro games is fixed and finite. There never will be a new Game Boy Advance game to get excited about. True, it&rsquo;d take time to play through this whole library, even the subset that I now have loaded on my phone. But I think I&rsquo;d be much more excited by a new game in the style of these classics that I was able to play on my phone, rather than games I&rsquo;ve played in my past.</p>
<p>I hope the Wavelengths post is right that this does prove out the interest and audience for more immersive and gameplay focused mobile games, in the spirit of these retro classics that many love.</p>

<p>This article on Forbes describes the memetic leader behind a major group of AI proponents, a movement called &ldquo;effective accelerationism&rdquo; or &ldquo;e/acc&rdquo;. And it pits them against another movement known as effective altruism  or &ldquo;EA&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The e/acc movement believes in unfettered technological progress, while the EA movement tends to espouse caution and, often, regulation.</p>
<p>The whole OpenAI brouhaha seems like it might boil down to a conflict between these two movements.</p>
<p>Reading this article, I get the feeling that my own beliefs are not well aligned with either movement. There&rsquo;s so many unknowns about the future of AI and its impact on humanity. But, if we assume that it is going to be another large technological leap forward, and a fundamental advancement in computation and human computer interaction, then it feels important to consider where the dominant movements driving AI forward will bring us. I fear, with either movement, if played out to their logical conclusions, might result in similar dystopian outcomes.</p>
<p>The question I would want to consider in either movement is: &ldquo;Who owns the machine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With e/acc&rsquo;s hyper-capitalist ideas, I think a limited set of corporations would own the means of operating advanced AI. Capitalism tends to concentrate wealth and power in a limited set of hands.</p>
<p>With EA, it might be the government (and whatever limited companies they grant a license to). Regulation and strict control tend to also concentrate power in a few places.</p>
<p>Either outcome seems bad.</p>
<p>Compare this to earlier computer advancements that tended to <em>decentralize</em> innovation and control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of the early days of the Web. Or even earlier to the dawn of the personal computer, where <a href="https://www.lainenooney.com/the-apple-ii-age.html">Laine Nooney‚Äôs book on the software ecosystem of the Apple II</a> shows a history where innovation via many independent developers, creating software that empowered entirely new industries. Personal computers, solving problems in the lives of everyday people.</p>
<p>If AI is going to be as impactful as the Web and even the personal computer, I think we ought to consider how we can decentralize this advancement. What models allow for this technology to be owned and operated by everyone? What models tend to consolidate power into a few hands? What keeps the computer a tool that empowers the user, and what makes it a machine that enriches and empowers a select few?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But nestled in a relatively short span of time is the era of cassette-based loading, where actual audio tapes could have data stored on them, and played back to load into computers. In terms of adoption, the cassette-based software period is marked by people entering it and almost immediately clawing their way out of it as soon as they can afford to.</p>

			 <p>Kottke is <a href="https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today">celebrating turning 25 years old</a> which is an interesting look back at his experience with the web and how it has changed over the years.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the <a href="https://kottke.org/16/10/www-the-way-we-were">linked 2016 post about the web as it appeared on Halt and Catch Fire</a>. I loved that show when it was on the air and reading this made me miss it.</p>
<p>Despite the nostalgia, this post ends on a concerned note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the open Web enthusiasts and advocates missed an opportunity to take what the Web was in the 
90s and make that available to everyone. Instead of walled gardens like Facebook, Pinterest, and Medium (which echo the closed online services like AOL, Prodigy, and Compuserve that predated the Web), imagine a bunch of smaller services bound together with open protocols where individuals have both freedom and convenience. At this stage, building an open Twitter or open Facebook is nearly impossible, but it wouldn‚Äôt have been 10-12 years ago. I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but with all of the entrenched incumbents and money pumping into online services, I‚Äôm afraid that time has truly passed. And it‚Äôs breaking my heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to look back and think about how the open Web landscape has or has not changed since 2016. As recently as the past year, I felt that the open Web was in a more precarious position than ever. Between mobile apps and strict &ldquo;app store only&rdquo; policies, Web3 (which really seemed to be more about walled gardens accessed by crypto rather than the open Web), and social networks, things felt dire.</p>
<p>But today? It feels like there&rsquo;s a little more hope in the air. Perhaps I&rsquo;m overly weighting the decline of Twitter and rise of Mastodon/ActivityPub (even RSS is getting more attention recently!), but it feels like things are shifting in a positive direction.</p>

			 <p>Microsoft has, from what I&rsquo;ve seen, the most compelling use case of AI to augment work: <a href="https://youtu.be/Bf-dbS9CcRU">YouTube announcement video</a></p>
<p>I can definitely see myself using an AI assistant for work tasks like they demo. My big question is how accurate and trust worthy will it be? Will it hallucinate summaries of a missed meeting and lead you to the wrong conclusions? Seems it has the ability to cite it&rsquo;s references, which is great if you want to double check or dig deeper into something it&rsquo;s highlighting. But I&rsquo;d also need to have enough trust in the system to not feel the need to follow references just for validating its conclusions.</p>
<p>Next, is <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/">Mozilla funding an AI startup</a> (via <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/03/24/mozilla-ai/">Michael Tsai</a>) with the goals of creating trustworthy and  open source AI models. I&rsquo;m glad to see this effort launch. If AI is really going to be as impactful as people think it will be, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a technical capability that is only owned by corporations and governments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on the fence about whether this manifestation of AI will usher in the future of human computer interaction, or it will be a fruitless experiment that results in cool demos but nothing more.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/01/04/southwest-airlines-and-technical-debt/">Michael Tsai on Southwest Airlines and Technical Debt</a></p>
<p>This is a really interesting take on how technical debt directly contributed to Southwest&rsquo;s terrible week.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/southwest-airlines-computers.html">Zeynep Tufekci&rsquo;s article on the NYT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs been an open secret within Southwest for some time, and a shameful one, that the company desperately needed to modernize its scheduling systems. Software shortcomings contributed to previous, smaller-scale meltdowns, and Southwest unions had repeatedly warned about the software. Without more government regulation and oversight and greater accountability, we may see more fiascos like this one, which most likely stranded hundreds of thousands of Southwest passengers ‚Äî perhaps more than a million ‚Äî over Christmas week. And not just for a single company, as the problem is widespread across many industries.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This problem ‚Äî relying on older or deficient software that needs updating ‚Äî is known as incurring technical debt, meaning there is a gap between what the software needs to be and what it is. While aging code is a common cause of technical debt in older companies ‚Äî such as with airlines, which started automating early ‚Äî it can also be found in newer systems, because software can be written in a rapid and shoddy way, rather than in a more resilient manner that makes it more dependable and easier to fix or expand. As you might expect, quicker is cheaper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s so insiduous about technical debt is there&rsquo;s not always an obvious, clear measurement that you&rsquo;ve taken on too much. Every software system has some amount of technical debt, but it&rsquo;s a challenge, even for experienced software engineers, to guage the level of debt. It&rsquo;s not equivalent to the physical world where you can see if something is crumbling or has some other type of defect.</p>
<p>In some cases, software&rsquo;s technical debt may be obvious, for example if its running on hardware or software that is no longer available or updated by it&rsquo;s developers. COBOL running on a mainframe is a good example.</p>
<p>However, as Tufekci&rsquo;s article states, even newer software can suffer from technical debt. On the contrary, it is possible for old software to be well maintained and have an acceptable amount of technical debt. For example, many modern operating systems (such as Linux) are decades old yet remain well maintained and cutting edge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely that Southwest runs on programming languages and operating systems that are actively updated, but the debt lies in the software that they&rsquo;ve written and runs their business. This is probably the case that a lot of companies in the 10-20 year old range fall into, and they would not be unique if they had technical debt that has gone out of control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an industry problem. We lack the tools and techniques to appropriately guage tech debt in quantifiable ways. How much technical debt is too much and how much impact it may have on a business boils down to opinion. Different engineers will debate with each other on this topic. There&rsquo;s no standard, industry bechmarks or regulations to turn to, unlike other fields of engineering.</p>
<p>Perhaps our field will develop such standards, but my hunch is that software is unique enough from other engineering disciplines that we may never be able to develop such standards. I&rsquo;d like to be wrong about this.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of productive cases of measuring tech debt? Or systemic ways to keep it within a maintainable limit?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve heard most of these stories in isolation, but haven&rsquo;t read anything that summarizes the downfall of the whole industry like this. I do wonder where things go from here.

<p>There&rsquo;s two things here for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why so much fear around TikTok specifically? In theory their privacy risks are the same with any app or social network. I don&rsquo;t think they are unique in this regard.</li>
<li>I think this is another reason we should really strive to move social networking to open and decentralized protocols and solve the problems inherit to this model. The risks of centralized aggregators is too great.</li>

			 <p>I decided to take a break from Twitter. In short, the doom-scrolling became too much for me. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever be back. Rather than seek an alternative in Mastodon, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can avoid re-creating another firehose of content for me. I like the balance of my slower timeline here on Micro.blog with its Mastodon/ActivityPub support, which I&rsquo;ll be using to follow sparingly (you can certainly follow my posts here <a href="https://micro.blog/dfj?remote_follow=1">@dfj@doug.pub</a> on Mastodon).</p>
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can get my RSS feeds into a managable place. I&rsquo;m excited about the idea of returning to more decetralized feeds through standard Web technologies. I&rsquo;m hoping the Twitter exodus helps create a new demand for products and tools in this space.</p>

<p>An interesting look at how the internet will potentially evolve. I&rsquo;ve certainly been cognizant of the centralization of technology and means of communication. I do hope we find a good balance where the key technologies can be decentralized. Open protocols seems to be a major part of this.</p>

<p>The main issue is, non-standard standards.
I.e. the bad habit the web has taken to require devs to adopt new APIs that are not finalized and will break in a matter of years.</p>

			 <p>It seems a common reaction to the news of the M1 in the iPad Pro is that the iPad‚Äôs software is holding it back; you can‚Äôt fully utilize the hardware with iPadOS. There‚Äôs been speculation that the next step might be to run Mac apps or Mac OS on the iPad.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs amusing to see this swing when I feel like a few years ago there was fear that Apple was abandoning the Mac and the iPad was the future. I think this came from a place where the Mac hardware was in a bad spot and Apple wasn‚Äôt pushing forward fast enough (butterfly keyboard!).</p>
<p>Now, at a power and battery life level, Mac and iPad are roughly equivalent. That leaves form factor and software as the differentiators. I wonder for how long the iPad Pro‚Äôs form factor will be considered enough of a differentiator that people will find it worth the price in addition to a Mac. From the reaction, it seems that for most ‚Äúpro‚Äù use cases, iPadOS doesn‚Äôt feel sufficient. I think I‚Äôm in this boat. I manipulate text all day (code and documents) and without the battery life advantage, there‚Äôs really no longer a selling point to the iPad for me. My work is worse or impossible* on an iPad, so why would I buy one when it‚Äôs similar cost to a Mac laptop?</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what steps Apple takes here. I think WWDC will shed some light or at least give hints at where they are going.</p>
<p>*: Yes I can ssh to a server and code, but that‚Äôs a giant step down in UX for me.</p>
