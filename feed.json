				"content_html": "<p>Hello and welcome to another travel report, this time on our short trip to the area around Apalachicola in Florida&rsquo;s panhandle with my wife and our two dogs.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been to Florida, you may have noticed that they like to give catchy names to their numerous coasts. Here is no different and is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Florida&rsquo;s forgotten coast.&rdquo; Sounds ominous, but in fact we found it beautiful and had a wonderful time.

				"content_text": "\nHello and welcome to another travel report, this time on our short trip to the area around Apalachicola in Florida's panhandle with my wife and our two dogs.\n\nIf you've been to Florida, you may have noticed that they like to give catchy names to their numerous coasts. Here is no different and is sometimes referred to as \"Florida's forgotten coast.\" Sounds ominous, but in fact we found it beautiful and had a wonderful time. But it does live up to this name, at least in our experience during this trip: the crowds forgot to come! Typically, winter is the peak season for Florida, but we were pretty shocked to find that's not the case here, at least not this particular week in December.

Here on the blog, I'll be using the [📷: Everyday](https://doug.pub/categories/everyday/) category to organize these posts.\n\nEveryday 001:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0105.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"A colorful, empty tennis court is surrounded by trees and a stone wall.\">\n\nEveryday 002:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0165.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"A rusty chain-link gate with the word CLAY in large letters stands amidst fallen leaves, trees, and cemetary in the background.\">\n",

				"title": "Travel Report: Italy in Review 🇮🇹",
				"content_html": "<p>Hello from Delta flight 67 Rome to Atlanta!</p>\n<p>Now that our time in Italy has wrapped up, I thought I&rsquo;d try to compile some thoughts on our overall experience in Italy. This was my first time traveling in Italy. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to visit for some time since I love Italian food and I have some heritage in Italy via my mother&rsquo;s side of the family (according to my DNA report, I&rsquo;m just under 25% genetically Italian heritage). And, for various reasons, the Italian culture is the one that has prevailed in my family&rsquo;s traditions. So, the trip was more meaningful to me than most.</p>\n<p>In short, our time in Italy was fantastic! The food and scenery both exceeded my expectations. The food especially just seems so much better than what we have access to in the US. Even simple, raw ingredients, like a tomato, tasted much better than anything I&rsquo;ve had before. And for more complex ingredients like olive oil and cheese, well, Italy is just producing stuff on another level compared to America. I&rsquo;m definitely returning home feeling inspired to do what I can to find local, fresh ingredients for meals at home.</p>\n<p>One experience that is really sticking with me is making pasta in our airbnb. The host provided the ingredients and suggested a simple preparation of just olive oil and cheese crumbled on top, which is what we did. We simply cooked the orecchiette in salted water, topped it with olive oil, salt, and crumbled cheese. We added fresh tomatoes as garnish. This dish was fantastic! And it took all of 15 minutes to prepare. I&rsquo;ve cooked a lot of pasta at home in the US and I&rsquo;ve never had something be so easy and incredibly delicious. There was no skill on our part, so the only explanation is really great ingredients.</p>\n<p>Looking back to the places we visited, in order: Rome, Florence, Tuscany, Puglia. I don&rsquo;t think I can pick a favorite. In fact, I think a highlight was visiting multiple regions and seeing the differences in food and culture. We learned about Italian history and how most cities (and the regions around them) were distinct with their own cultures and dialects until Italian unification in 1861. Even to this day, these regional differences carry on. We learned of a few different dialects and how different they are from one another. So, if you visit Italy, I&rsquo;d definitely suggest visiting a few regions to experience these differences.</p>\n<p>In Rome, we loved seeing the ancient Roman history in the Colosseum and Imperial Forum. It&rsquo;s amazing to have a view onto this ancient civilization and see the city they built. It&rsquo;s also incredible to think that Rome has been inhabited continuously since antiquity. We also enjoyed modern Rome, meaning it&rsquo;s a vibrant city beyond the touristy parts. This means you can find authentic, local food without too much trouble. Some of our favorite dishes were in Rome.</p>\n<p>Florence was amazing to see the art and the beautiful Renaissance era buildings and streets. If you stay in the central part of the city, it&rsquo;s very walkable. Florence is also very touristy, every street is filled with tourists. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, but is the reality of visiting the historic parts of Florence. The food can be great here too, we had one of the best meals of our trip here. So, it&rsquo;s certainly possible to avoid tourist traps and find great places.</p>\n<p>Tuscany was beautiful. Just driving through the countryside, or even better, biking through it, gives you so many scenic views. I enjoyed that we got to stay at a farmhouse and enjoy some agritourism while we were there. Visiting all the small Tuscany towns was very fun too, each one has its own unique history and feel to it. Of course, the food is great in Tuscany. We loved the handmade pici pasta, and had one of the best cacio e pepe dishes of our trip in Tuscany. The wine is great here too, and it was fun to visit a few vineyards and see exactly where the grapes came from.</p>\n<p>Finally, our time in Puglia was great as well. While both Puglia and Tuscany are heavily into agriculture, I think Puglia exceeds Tuscany in this regard, giving you access to fresh, local foods almost everywhere you go. In fact, many of the foods we had in Puglia were the best on our trip. We loved the bread (especially the focaccia), cheese, meats, and seafood here. Puglia is also a lot less touristy than Tuscany, especially if you get away from the coast and head inland. Our e-bike tour through Puglia was one of the best rides of my life. The Pugliese countryside is beautiful in its own, unique way. I also loved the cities rendered in white, from the cobblestone streets to the buildings. Puglia definitely felt as if it could have been a different country from Tuscany and the cities of Rome and Florence.</p>\n<p>So, overall the trip was great! I&rsquo;m already thinking about when we might be able to return to Italy. I&rsquo;m definitely going to miss the great food (and lack of humidity) after returning home!</p>\n<h2 id=\"housekeeping-and-thoughts-on-blogging\">Housekeeping and thoughts on blogging</h2>\n<p>Just a quick housekeeping note: I&rsquo;ve gone back and added categories to all these Travel Report posts to make it easier to find them and read any that were missed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://doug.pub/categories/italy-2024/\">Italy 2024</a> category for just the reports on Italy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doug.pub/categories/europe-train-journey-2024/\">Europe Train Journey 2024</a> category for the posts on my earlier <a href=\"https://doug.pub/2024/05/18/europe-train-adventure.html\">Europe Train Adventure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doug.pub/categories/travel-report/\">Travel Report</a> for every travel report posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find these categories and all my prior posts on the <a href=\"https://doug.pub/archive/\">Archive</a> page.</p>\n<p>This trip was the first time that I&rsquo;ve tried blogging about travel and I&rsquo;m very happy that I decided to do this.

We loved the handmade pici pasta, and had one of the best cacio e pepe dishes of our trip in Tuscany. The wine is great here too, and it was fun to visit a few vineyards and see exactly where the grapes came from. \n\nFinally, our time in Puglia was great as well. While both Puglia and Tuscany are heavily into agriculture, I think Puglia exceeds Tuscany in this regard, giving you access to fresh, local foods almost everywhere you go. In fact, many of the foods we had in Puglia were the best on our trip. We loved the bread (especially the focaccia), cheese, meats, and seafood here. Puglia is also a lot less touristy than Tuscany, especially if you get away from the coast and head inland. Our e-bike tour through Puglia was one of the best rides of my life. The Pugliese countryside is beautiful in its own, unique way. I also loved the cities rendered in white, from the cobblestone streets to the buildings. Puglia definitely felt as if it could have been a different country from Tuscany and the cities of Rome and Florence. \n\nSo, overall the trip was great! I'm already thinking about when we might be able to return to Italy. I'm definitely going to miss the great food (and lack of humidity) after returning home!\n\n## Housekeeping and thoughts on blogging\n\nJust a quick housekeeping note: I've gone back and added categories to all these Travel Report posts to make it easier to find them and read any that were missed:\n\n* [Italy 2024](https://doug.pub/categories/italy-2024/) category for just the reports on Italy. \n* [Europe Train Journey 2024](https://doug.pub/categories/europe-train-journey-2024/) category for the posts on my earlier [Europe Train Adventure](https://doug.pub/2024/05/18/europe-train-adventure.html)\n* [Travel Report](https://doug.pub/categories/travel-report/) for every travel report posts\n\nYou can find these categories and all my prior posts on the [Archive](https://doug.pub/archive/) page. \n\nThis trip was the first time that I've tried blogging about travel and I'm very happy that I decided to do this. Not only has it been a nice way to share with family and friends what I've been up to, but I'm happy to have it for myself as a detailed log of what I did. It's also been fun to reflect on every step of the trip and think of what I wan to write about and which photos I want to share. It's been a fun creative outlet.\n\nSo, thank you for following along! I hope you've enjoyed reading these as much as I did writing them. I don't currently have any big trips planned in the future, but whenever I travel next, I think I'll keep up with the travel reports.

				"content_html": "<p>Hello from Puglia, aboard the train headed to Rome. Puglia was the last leg of our trip in Italy, aside from tonight in Rome before we catch our flight back to Atlanta tomorrow.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s cover what we got into in Puglia!</p>\n<p>We stayed in a house just outside the city of Noci. It was a great property with beautiful gardens. It really felt like we were deep in the countryside even though we were a kilometer or two from town.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where we stayed.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/25d0ff9a-4995-4e87-b8b2-55d0eea22e77.jpg\" alt=\"A rustic stone house surrounded by trees and greenery. There is a small patio area with a metal table and chairs on the right. The ground is covered in gravel and there is an old wooden door on the house. The sky is partly cloudy.\"></p>\n<p>On our first full day, the main event was an e-bike tour around the Pugliese countryside. We started in Alberobello which is known for buildings with conical stacked stone roofs known as trulli. In fact, you can find these buildings all over Puglia, but they are concentrated in Alberobello, and some have been converted into shops and hotels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/885df7dc-7e3d-4c46-94b3-6f3fb2e3a004.jpg\" alt=\"This image shows a narrow street lined with traditional whitewashed stone houses featuring conical roofs, known as trulli, under a clear blue sky. The houses have small flower pots placed along the sidewalk. The overall scene is bright and tranquil.\"></p>\n<p>We spent some time here, seeing the trulli up close and we even were able to enter one. These buildings are often 100s of years old and very rustic. Living in them can be a hard life, since you don&rsquo;t have many modern comforts. We learned that for this reason, maybe 20-30 years ago, most people were trying to get out of Alberobello to live somewhere more modern. It wasn&rsquo;t until relatively recently that it became more of a tourist attraction and owning a trulli became more desirable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bc352d03-3f0a-4b50-ad01-7079de1c8111.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up view of a traditional trullo house with whitewashed stone walls and a conical roof made of stone slabs.

We drank caffè Lecce, which is espresso over ice with sweet almond syrup (more on this later). I&rsquo;m glad we were introduced to this drink, because it&rsquo;s great! Especially on a hot day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/92e80897-493a-47fa-afea-e0efefa8711a.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a historical town square featuring a semi-circular colonnade with arches and a two-story building with balconies.

The image features cloudy skies, green vineyards, farmland, and scattered buildings surrounded by vegetation. A sign reading &ldquo;SIROSE&rdquo; is visible near the bottom of the stairs.\"></p>\n<p>Here we had a &ldquo;light&rdquo; lunch featuring some typical Pugliese foods, such as cappicola, focaccia, bruschetta, burrata, and orecchiette. Everything was extremely delicious! I especially loved the focaccia we had in Puglia. Often it was made with a darker grain that gave it more flavor. I think the focaccia here is the best I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cfacd4e2-fd1b-4a3f-af96-bde52549f0f6.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a beard and a yellow cap sits at an outdoor table.

I recorded our route on <a href=\"https://strava.app.link/u5oBWkt7uKb\">Strava</a> if you are curious for more detail. At 50 kilometers, it was a long ride, but very fun! One of the best rides of my life!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/275c7e97-70c0-46d6-a42c-322d88933086.jpg\" alt=\"Strava map showing a 50-kilometer e-bike ride route around Puglia, Italy.

We learned how the different pens are used to group cows that are different stages of their milk production cycle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1bad3d58-8b13-4f0b-8b42-0bd851b75c7c.jpg\" alt=\"A livestock farm with a dirt-covered ground, a large manure pile, and several weathered concrete structures.

He explained that you only need 3 things for cheese: milk, salt, and enzymes.</p>\n<p>For this demonstration, he started with fresh cheese curds and added salt and hot water then began to mix and stretch it with a wooden pallet.</p>\n<p>Here the curds are being stirred with the added salt and water.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/90821506-4769-46f5-b0b2-c9b4ae5cc333.jpg\" alt=\"A group of people wearing hairnets and protective shoe covers are observing a cheesemaker demonstrate cheese-making.

Here&rsquo;s Beth making burrata, which is stretchy mozzarella filled with stracciatella (strips of mozzarella\tand cream). We got to eat what we made and it was the best! So fresh and flavorful. I&rsquo;ve never had burrata this good before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5064099f-bb57-4cac-8a11-b173eab54131.jpg\" alt=\"Two individuals are engaged in a cheesemaking process in a dairy facility.

The landscape around the town consists of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation.\"></p>\n<p>We learned the history of Matera, which is vast. The civilization originally started as cave dwellings carved into the rock cliffs along the stream. Over time, people built on top of the caves, adding stonework to create buildings. However, every building is at least partially carved into the rock. Many buildings have vast caves below them. At least, if you were well off you could afford to have a building above ground. Many of the poorer residents lived entirely in caves with no access to fresh air.</p>\n<p>What was shocking was to learn how by the 1950s the city was in very rough shape. There was no running water or electricity. All of the residents were living life as if it was still the 1800s. Malaria and other diseases ran rampant as it was impossible to maintain modern hygiene.</p>\n<p>The government eventually stepped in and evicted everyone from the historic part of the city, into new public houses that was constructed adjacent to the historic buildings. So, from the 1950s until about 1990, the historic buildings sat vacant. Our tour guide told us that at one point, the government considered just demolishing the historic city, but abandoned the idea when they determined the amount of dynamite needed would be too costly</p>\n<p>So, the city sat vacant until the 1990s. At this point, the government decided to try and create a tourist destination. Modern utilities were installed and buildings were rented out to businesses. But, things didn&rsquo;t really catch on until about 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>Now, the city is in full tourist mode, with Michelin star restaurants and 5 star hotels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/69ef0327-11a1-4b2f-a6b4-f63cfdcc2ccf.jpg\" alt=\"Historic stone buildings densely packed on a hillside under a cloudy sky.

I really loved this region of Italy. The countryside is beautiful, and we had some of the best food of our trip here. If you visit Italy, I&rsquo;d highly recommend Puglia. It can be a lot less touristy compared to Tuscany and gives you an opportunity for more authentic experience.</p>\n<p>So, we have tonight in Rome, then we&rsquo;ve reached the end of our time in Italy. It&rsquo;s been fantastic! I&rsquo;m happy that we were able to see the big attractions in Rome and Florence and then spend substantial time in the countrysides of Tuscany and Puglia. It&rsquo;ll be hard to leave Italy!</p>\n<p>Ciao!</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Hello from Puglia, aboard the train headed to Rome. Puglia was the last leg of our trip in Italy, aside from tonight in Rome before we catch our flight back to Atlanta tomorrow.\n\nSo, let's cover what we got into in Puglia! \n\nWe stayed in a house just outside the city of Noci. It was a great property with beautiful gardens. It really felt like we were deep in the countryside even though we were a kilometer or two from town. \n\nHere's where we stayed.\n![A rustic stone house surrounded by trees and greenery. There is a small patio area with a metal table and chairs on the right. The ground is covered in gravel and there is an old wooden door on the house. The sky is partly cloudy.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/25d0ff9a-4995-4e87-b8b2-55d0eea22e77.jpg)\n\nOn our first full day, the main event was an e-bike tour around the Pugliese countryside. We started in Alberobello which is known for buildings with conical stacked stone roofs known as trulli. In fact, you can find these buildings all over Puglia, but they are concentrated in Alberobello, and some have been converted into shops and hotels. \n\n![This image shows a narrow street lined with traditional whitewashed stone houses featuring conical roofs, known as trulli, under a clear blue sky. The houses have small flower pots placed along the sidewalk. The overall scene is bright and tranquil.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/885df7dc-7e3d-4c46-94b3-6f3fb2e3a004.jpg)\n\nWe spent some time here, seeing the trulli up close and we even were able to enter one. These buildings are often 100s of years old and very rustic. Living in them can be a hard life, since you don't have many modern comforts. We learned that for this reason, maybe 20-30 years ago, most people were trying to get out of Alberobello to live somewhere more modern. It wasn't until relatively recently that it became more of a tourist attraction and owning a trulli became more desirable. \n\n![A close-up view of a traditional trullo house with whitewashed stone walls and a conical roof made of stone slabs. The house features a chimney and an arched entrance covered with a curtain. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bc352d03-3f0a-4b50-ad01-7079de1c8111.jpg)\n\nUs on our tour bikes in Alberobello.\n\n![A bearded man and a woman, both wearing helmets and sunglasses, are posing with their bicycles in front of a traditional stone building with a conical roof.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e84f7066-d661-41ea-bc9a-94fe9825ef92.jpg)\n\n![A scenic view of the traditional trulli houses in Alberobello, Italy.

We drank caffè Lecce, which is espresso over ice with sweet almond syrup (more on this later). I'm glad we were introduced to this drink, because it's great! Especially on a hot day.\n\n![Image of a historical town square featuring a semi-circular colonnade with arches and a two-story building with balconies.

The image features cloudy skies, green vineyards, farmland, and scattered buildings surrounded by vegetation. A sign reading \"SIROSE\" is visible near the bottom of the stairs.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ce272b13-cd8c-4d88-85ea-7fa5e8ed8203.jpg)\n\nHere we had a \"light\" lunch featuring some typical Pugliese foods, such as cappicola, focaccia, bruschetta, burrata, and orecchiette. Everything was extremely delicious! I especially loved the focaccia we had in Puglia. Often it was made with a darker grain that gave it more flavor. I think the focaccia here is the best I've ever had. \n\n![A man with a beard and a yellow cap sits at an outdoor table. In front of him are a glass of white wine, a plate of sliced cured meat, and a bowl of bread topped with cherry tomatoes. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cfacd4e2-fd1b-4a3f-af96-bde52549f0f6.jpg)\n\nOur ride completed by circling back to Alberobello. I recorded our route on [Strava](https://strava.app.link/u5oBWkt7uKb) if you are curious for more detail. At 50 kilometers, it was a long ride, but very fun! One of the best rides of my life!\n\n![Strava map showing a 50-kilometer e-bike ride route around Puglia, Italy.

The focal point is a tall, red clock tower with a white clock face and a dome roof. The tower is flanked by whitewashed buildings with green shutters and balconies. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/8df59233-7d25-4883-bdff-cf1dab14e342.jpg)\n\nThe next day, we drove south to head to tour a dairy farm that specializes in cheese. \n\nOne of the pens where cows are kept. We learned how the different pens are used to group cows that are different stages of their milk production cycle. \n\n![A livestock farm with a dirt-covered ground, a large manure pile, and several weathered concrete structures. Two pigeons are perched on one of the structures. The sky is partly cloudy.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1bad3d58-8b13-4f0b-8b42-0bd851b75c7c.jpg)\n\nSome of their cows resting in the shade. \n\n![A group of cows resting inside a partially open shed, with a mix of black-and-white and brown cows. Hay is scattered on the ground, and there is an open view of fields and trees in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e07d3f62-186e-40d8-bfd0-b128245f3028.jpg)\n\nThen, we got to tour the cheese laboratory, as they called it. \n\n![Two people are in a cheese-making facility. One person, wearing a hairnet, suspenders, and shoe covers, looks at their phone. The other person, dressed in white protective clothing, including a hat, apron, and boots, holds cheese. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5ec1c195-d6c4-4792-b693-79b8e68036b6.jpg)\n\nHoping I got \"accidentally\" locked in the cheese aging room. \n\n![A storage room filled with shelves and racks holding various types and shapes of cheese. On the left, multiple rows of round, wheel-shaped cheeses are stacked on wooden shelves. On the right, round cheeses with a bulbous shape are hanging from metal racks. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ee414087-adc9-4c7e-ad4a-400920f5ec66.jpg)\n\nThen, the highlight of the tour, watching one of the cheesemakers demonstrate how to make fresh mozzarella. He explained that you only need 3 things for cheese: milk, salt, and enzymes. \n\nFor this demonstration, he started with fresh cheese curds and added salt and hot water then began to mix and stretch it with a wooden pallet. \n\nHere the curds are being stirred with the added salt and water. \n\n![A group of people wearing hairnets and protective shoe covers are observing a cheesemaker demonstrate cheese-making.

A person is lifting a large, stretchy mass of curd from a wooden vat using a long wooden stick.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f8ffb20f-fa84-48d2-85e5-a9fa19160cf8.jpg)\n\nAnd the stretching is finished when he was able to stretch it above his head. \n\n![A group of people, wearing hair nets, watches a cheesemaker demonstrating the process of making cheese in a rustic, stone-vaulted room. The cheesemaker is pulling and stretching the cheese curds, which are cascading into a wooden barrel.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/30f55337-70d5-4eb7-b29b-2de5746cd98a.jpg)\n\nAfter all the stretching, he started to shape it by hand, demonstrating 4 different shapes: knots, braids, ball, and burrata. \n\n![A group of people watching a demonstration of traditional cheese-making. The instructor is handling fresh cheese curds, pulling them into a stretchy mass. Various bowls and a wooden bucket with a milk-based liquid are on a metal countertop. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/777f6c14-d319-4397-88af-0f307579c118.jpg)\n\nBut the highlight was being able to shape the cheese ourselves! Here's Beth making burrata, which is stretchy mozzarella filled with stracciatella (strips of mozzarella\tand cream). We got to eat what we made and it was the best! So fresh and flavorful. I've never had burrata this good before. \n\n![Two individuals are engaged in a cheesemaking process in a dairy facility. They are wearing hygienic hairnets and aprons.

The sky is clear and blue.

The building's exterior shows some weathering, and there are patches of greenery on the rocks.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/544cc3c4-5729-4b07-b9ae-f9053f21fd44.jpg)\n\nA sample of the fresh seafood they had that night. We ended up eating the lobster and scorpion fish. \n\n![A platter of fresh seafood, including various types of fish and a lobster with rubber bands around its claws, is displayed on a white tablecloth in an outdoor dining setting with a sea view in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7c59e8df-5416-46cd-9724-3de80179149d.jpg)\n\nSunset at Capitolo was very pretty!\n\n![A coastal scene at sunset featuring a rocky shoreline.

Shops on both sides display various items, including signs for \"APULIA.\" People stroll along the cobblestone path under a clear blue sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c2e3ec7b-03f7-4683-b3e6-370b4f56b45f.jpg)\n\nA cool portal onto the harbor. \n\n![View from a stone archway showing three people looking out at a harbor with boats.

I love the white render buildings and the white stone streets. \n\n![The image shows an old stone building with a tower, featuring intricate architectural details, standing under a clear blue sky.

The drink is named after the city of Lecce and is served as espresso with a side of almond syrup and ice. \n\n![The image shows a glass of almond syrup with ice, a cup of espresso on a saucer with a spoon, and a bottle of water labeled \"Ferrarelle.\" They are placed on a beige perforated table.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f74ad951-7af3-46bd-9d62-01162aa07f3a.jpg)\n\nYou pour the espresso into the glass, letting the cup rest upside down to make sure every drop of espresso makes it in. \n\n![A white coffee cup is placed upside down inside a glass filled with a two-layered liquid, coffee and almond syrup.

I love this drink. I'll have to try and find the right kind of almond syrup in the US so I can make this at home. \n\n![A glass of iced coffee sits next to an empty white coffee cup with a spoon inside on a perforated beige table.

Here we had a boat tour, which was a great way to see the coast.\n\n\nBeth gets the photo credit for all the pics from the boat. \n\n![View of coastal caves and rocky cliffs with blue-green water in the foreground.

There's even a statue of him that we saw from the boat. However, our guide told us that the statue and celebration of Domenico is just for the tourists and the people from Polignano don't like the signer because he claimed to be from Sicily rather than his true birthplace of Polignano a Mare. \n\n![A charming evening street scene in an Italian town.

We were lucky enough to meet the cheese maker himself, Vito Dicecca, who was very nice. He stopped by our table a few times to chat with us and see what we thought of his cheese. We tasted a lot of cheese, and they were all great, but his signature blue cheese served as a cake topped with cherry was the star!\n\n![A slice of cake topped with berries is on a speckled cake stand, accompanied by a fork.

The landscape around the town consists of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5d1b46cf-b7c0-4412-a335-65ce505a0ded.jpg)\n\nWe learned the history of Matera, which is vast. The civilization originally started as cave dwellings carved into the rock cliffs along the stream. Over time, people built on top of the caves, adding stonework to create buildings. However, every building is at least partially carved into the rock. Many buildings have vast caves below them. At least, if you were well off you could afford to have a building above ground. Many of the poorer residents lived entirely in caves with no access to fresh air. \n\nWhat was shocking was to learn how by the 1950s the city was in very rough shape. There was no running water or electricity. All of the residents were living life as if it was still the 1800s. Malaria and other diseases ran rampant as it was impossible to maintain modern hygiene. \n\nThe government eventually stepped in and evicted everyone from the historic part of the city, into new public houses that was constructed adjacent to the historic buildings. So, from the 1950s until about 1990, the historic buildings sat vacant. Our tour guide told us that at one point, the government considered just demolishing the historic city, but abandoned the idea when they determined the amount of dynamite needed would be too costly\n\n\nSo, the city sat vacant until the 1990s. At this point, the government decided to try and create a tourist destination. Modern utilities were installed and buildings were rented out to businesses. But, things didn't really catch on until about 10 years ago. \n\nNow, the city is in full tourist mode, with Michelin star restaurants and 5 star hotels.\n\n![Historic stone buildings densely packed on a hillside under a cloudy sky.

The architecture features a mix of arches, stairs, and balconies with weathered textures.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/69ef0327-11a1-4b2f-a6b4-f63cfdcc2ccf.jpg)\n\nHowever, it can be a surprising mix, as you'll pass buildings and areas of the city that still look completely abandoned and right next door is a swanky hotel. \n\n![A historic stone structure with a weathered, rustic appearance. The image shows a series of stone steps, lush greenery, and flowering plants in the foreground. Buildings with arched doorways and small windows are present, and the stone walls have plants growing. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c1cb94f2-c9cc-4b10-85b3-2c5f5cc27e13.jpg)\n\n![An ancient stone courtyard with weathered buildings featuring arched and rectangular doorways and windows.

I found Matera to be so fascinating and intriguing. It's hard to fathom that people have been living here for so long and how hard that life must have been. \n\n![View of the ancient city of Matera in Italy, featuring a dense cluster of historic stone buildings with tiled roofs and narrow streets.

I really loved this region of Italy. The countryside is beautiful, and we had some of the best food of our trip here. If you visit Italy, I'd highly recommend Puglia. It can be a lot less touristy compared to Tuscany and gives you an opportunity for more authentic experience. \n\nSo, we have tonight in Rome, then we've reached the end of our time in Italy. It's been fantastic! I'm happy that we were able to see the big attractions in Rome and Florence and then spend substantial time in the countrysides of Tuscany and Puglia. It'll be hard to leave Italy! \n\nCiao!\n\n",

At first, I was skeptical that we&rsquo;d need a mountain bike. By the end, I realized why. Some of our route was on essentially farm roads that could be gravel and fairly rough.

				"content_text": "\nCiao from Noci in the Puglia region of Italy!\n\nGet ready for a giant, image heavy post about our time in Tuscany! There's so much beautiful scenery, I absolutely failed to edit this down. \n\nTo start, and a big highlight of this part of our trip, was the Tuscan villa and farm where we stayed. This was outside Montefollonico with views of Montepulciano in the distance. \n\nIt was like a fairytale! \n\n![A rustic stone house surrounded by lush greenery and flowering plants, set against a backdrop of rolling hills and a clear blue sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2e26bf95-37b9-41d6-af3a-a4090c3b7b56.jpg)\n\n![A lush, green landscape featuring dense foliage in the foreground, with various plants and trees.

This region is famous for its wine production and beautiful medieval and Renaissance era town. \n\n![The image features an old cylindrical stone building with small windows and visible brickwork repairs.

At first, I was skeptical that we'd need a mountain bike. By the end, I realized why. Some of our route was on essentially farm roads that could be gravel and fairly rough. Even with an e-bike, the hills here are a challenge!\n\n![A person stands next to a mountain bike on a gravel path with a scenic view in the background.

I loved how informal it was here at Boscarelli. These vineyards really are small operations. \n\n![A rustic wooden table with various items, including wine bottles, glasses, papers, and a smartphone case.

The tower is situated next to a winding road with trees and vegetation nearby.

We are beginning to see the pattern that Tuscan towns are built on the hilltops, creating great views of the landscapes. \n\n![A scenic landscape featuring a lush, green valley with rows of olive trees and dense forest-covered hills. Scattered houses are visible, nestled among the trees, and mountains can be seen in the distance under a clear sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b7e7b128-83a5-44c4-9bb0-b4de100dae4e.jpg)\n\nWe visited another winery and agriturismo. This one, called Fattoria del Colle is run by women. Again, it's a small operation. \n\n![This image shows the interior of a winery cellar with various barrels and tanks used for storing and aging wine. There are large wooden barrels, a ceramic fermentation tank, and stainless steel vats.

It was really fun to learn about the process, seeing the older machinery (big granite wheels) alongside the newer (centrifuges that reduce contact with air). \n\n\n![An olive oil mill facility with machinery including a granite millstone crusher, a metal conveyor, and various stainless steel processing units.

A bridge crosses the river in the background, with a lit tower visible in the distance under a clear blue sky. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7de47cc2-f5bf-43c8-991c-eeba7ce4570a.jpg)\n\nThe next highlight is the Uffizi Gallery, which is right next to Palazzo Vecchio on Piazza della Signoria. The Uffizi was originally built by the Medicis as an administrative building. Now it houses mainly Renaissance era works of art. Some pieces are older and were acquired by the Medicis and other collectors. \n\n![A marble bust of a bearded man with flowing hair, depicted with a stern expression. Carved waves and zig-zag patterns are present on the bust's base. The sculpture is set against a plain background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dc46e214-9814-457f-a52f-d38f6f2ffea4.jpg)\n\n![A marble bust of a bearded man in historical attire is placed on a pedestal above an ornately carved wooden doorway.

The buildings on the bridge have brightly colored facades and numerous windows.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/eb362631-0d39-477f-8a1b-c493fdefed8c.jpg)\n\nJust happened to walk past this print shop while they were at work. You could smell the ink as we walked past. \n\n![A small, cozy art studio with arched ceilings and exposed brick walls. The walls are adorned with various framed artworks, including botanical prints, portraits, and maps.

It has been consistently good the entire time we've been in Italy. But the pasta at [Cibrèo Caffe](https://www.cibreo.com/caffe/) was amazing. \n\nSpinach and ricotta tortelloni. \n\n![A plate of green and yellow tortelloni with grated cheese on top, served with light sauce on a white plate.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/08dd63ca-f3ff-4940-a48c-06fca759150c.jpg)\n\nCacio e burro. \n\n![A white plate containing a serving of creamy pasta, likely tagliatelle, topped with grated cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper.

I had this quattro formagi and enjoyed it. I'm learning that I like almost anything with Gorgonzola on it. \n\n![A fresh, cheese-covered pizza on a dark plate, served with a glass of water. The table includes additional items, such as a bottle cap and a water bottle in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6a396a0b-5b86-4881-a370-6cf0e08aaca9.jpg)\n\nNext highlight is the Duomo. The facade is most intricate I've ever seen. \n\n![This image shows the intricate and ornate facade of Florence Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, in Florence, Italy. The focus is on the central main doors, which are richly decorated with religious carvings and sculptures. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b782a186-2f74-4d46-b2b3-ae69e0fa4fa1.jpg)\n\nThe interior is austere by comparison, but still beautiful. Check out the clock that was describe as working on \"Italian time.\"\n\n![The image shows the interior of a historic cathedral, featuring a large ornate clock on the wall above a dark wooden door, flanked by intricate stone carvings and religious frescoes.

We saw so many incredible things, it's impossible to capture it all. \n\nNext, we picked up a rental car and headed into the Tuscan countryside. I'll recap our time in Tuscany in the next post!\n\nBuonanotte!\n",

This is Trenitalia&rsquo;s Frecciarossa high speed train model ETR 1000, which I believe is the newer engine and cars.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/41dcd48f-14e3-47f2-be6d-ddac0cf67bb7.jpg\" alt=\"A modern red high-speed train is stationed on a platform in a large, arched train station with a glass and metal roof.

I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be feasible to travel at high speed over the mountains.</p>\n<p>My hotel was close enough that I decided to walk.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/035554da-324d-4f15-bc2a-6b54a1a89dab.jpg\" alt=\"A street scene in Rome.

				"content_text": "Ciao from Rome! With my arrival in Rome, this marks the end of my solo journey that started in London, England. I've managed to make it all this way with nothing but train travel and my own two feet!\n\nMilano centrale. \n\n![A modern train station platform with railway tracks beside it under a large arched, glass-roofed canopy. A digital clock and departure information display are visible overhead. There are ticket vending machines labeled \"Self Service\" and \"Biglietti\". ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c6621719-b13f-4e34-99ba-832faef650f2.jpg)\n\nBut before reflecting further, here's my ride from Milan. This is Trenitalia's Frecciarossa high speed train model ETR 1000, which I believe is the newer engine and cars. \n\n![A modern red high-speed train is stationed on a platform in a large, arched train station with a glass and metal roof. Passengers are standing on the platform near the train. A second train is visible on a neighboring track.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/41dcd48f-14e3-47f2-be6d-ddac0cf67bb7.jpg)\n\n![The image shows a Frecciarossa 1000 train labeled \"PREMIUM\" at a train station.

This is also where I wrote the majority of this post.\n\n![Interior of a high-speed train, specifically a Frecciarossa train by Trenitalia. The image shows rows of seats with red headrest covers, a table with a water bottle, and an electronic device. The train window displays blurred greenery outside. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/46f6c82e-d14e-454c-98b8-3bafd9c2cde1.jpg)\n\nArriving into Roma Termini.\n\n![A busy interior of a train station with travelers pulling suitcases and standing in line. The station features a high ceiling, large digital displays, and various shops along both sides. The floor is tiled in black.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1b865eac-a963-4db0-bae2-787a5c9e89dc.jpg)\n\nOverall the trip went smoothly. One thing that surprised me was how many tunnels, long completely dark tunnels, this trip entailed. Looking at the map, it makes sense, as we have to traverse multiple mountain ranges. I don't think it'd be feasible to travel at high speed over the mountains. \n\nMy hotel was close enough that I decided to walk.\n\n![A street scene in Rome. The view shows historical buildings with classic architecture on both sides. Scooters and motorcycles are parked along the cobblestone curb. People walk on the sidewalk under an overcast sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/035554da-324d-4f15-bc2a-6b54a1a89dab.jpg)\n\nIt's amazing to me that we are staying right next to the Roman Forum. These ruins are steps away from the hotel's front door. It's hard for me to believe that ruins from 2,000 years ago are just right here!\n\n![The image shows the ruins of an ancient stone building, with scattered stone fragments and remnants of columns in a grassy, open area. In the background, there are arched structures, a blue construction tent, and trees.

And the food was exactly what I was looking for, really good without being overly fancy or pretentious. I think I did alright ordering in a mix of bad Italian, English, and pointing. One thing I&rsquo;m learning, ChatGPT is pretty helpful with other languages (at least Italian and French). It provides a little more context and guidance than something like Google translate. It certainly helped me navigate this menu for some of the terms I did not recognize.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the dishes I had, it&rsquo;s tagliatelle with pulipo (octopus) and Gorgonzola. When I ordered, I was wondering if the Gorgonzola would be overpowering, but it wasn&rsquo;t!

I was lucky and found a place that seemed less touristy. At least, they did not have an English menu and my waiter did not speak English. Still, it was some of the friendliest service that I've had since entering Italy. And the food was exactly what I was looking for, really good without being overly fancy or pretentious. I think I did alright ordering in a mix of bad Italian, English, and pointing. One thing I'm learning, ChatGPT is pretty helpful with other languages (at least Italian and French). It provides a little more context and guidance than something like Google translate. It certainly helped me navigate this menu for some of the terms I did not recognize. \n\nHere's one of the dishes I had, it's tagliatelle with pulipo (octopus) and Gorgonzola. When I ordered, I was wondering if the Gorgonzola would be overpowering, but it wasn't! The dish was great and very well balanced.\n\n![A white plate filled with creamy pasta dish, tagliatelle, garnished with octopus.

Tomorrow, I take the high speed Trenitalia line to Rome!\n\nBuonanotte! \n\n\n",

Cloudy skies suggest overcast weather.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/684414eb-a2c4-4943-b5b4-3b2bd10decd3.jpg)\n\n![A mountain peak with some snow, against a cloudy sky, with the lower slopes covered in grass and some power lines visible in the foreground.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/124cd525-bf43-44f6-8f63-42199421a909.jpg)\n\nMy view from the top.\n\n![Snow-covered mountain landscape with overcast skies.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/789dda1d-6555-4f0e-b966-673b001cb1f3.jpg)\n\nNormally, the view from here includes several higher peaks, including Piz Bernina, which is the tallest peak in the eastern Alps. But, no such luck today. However, I do think parts of the glacier were visible when the clouds cooperated. I stayed for a bit to see if things would clear up some, but more clouds rolled in. It also snowed/sleeted very slightly. I was at about 10,000 ft of elevation and even with the clouds, it was a curious combination of being hot and cold at the same time. Cold because of the air, but hot because of what little bit of intense sun made it through the clouds. \n\nSo, I decided to head back down the mountain. Here's the view from the gondola on the way down.\n\n![Aerial view of a snowy mountain landscape with cable car lines disappearing into a cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6c7606f5-a2ed-439d-9ad4-d6dec058ee31.jpg)\n\n![A towering metal cable car structure with a mountainous background partially covered in snow under a cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6045f2da-08f0-4733-b2f3-dbe2138425e3.jpg)\n\nMy train back to St. Moritz pulling into the station.\n\n![A red train with the destination sign \"St. Moritz\" on the front, traveling on tracks surrounded by cars with a rocky, snow-patched mountain in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b65bf6a5-dfdf-4b1f-a8eb-bda6e6fbb4cf.jpg)\n\nFrom here, I returned to the hotel to have some tea and do some reading. I enjoyed the view of the lake and mountains while doing so.\n\nTonight, I'll have an early dinner at the hotel and an early night. Tomorrow, I have the Bernina Express which will travel through the Bernina Pass to Tirano, Italy. After a short stop there, I'll take a train to Milan.\n\nGoodnight!\n",

A lot of the advertising shows this train in winter, but I&rsquo;m glad that I was able to take it in the spring, as the green fields with wildflowers against the snow capped mountains made for stunning view after stunning view.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry that these photos do not do it justice. You&rsquo;ll have to take my word for it. Or, better yet, come and experience the Glacier Express for yourself!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/80138c45-e13e-46f4-94c7-43b69fe70637.jpg\" alt=\"A vibrant field of yellow flowers with a backdrop of towering mountains and a clear blue sky, taken from behind a window as evidenced by light reflections visible across the image.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ba699524-0d8d-4275-aa59-7dc9235efadb.jpg\" alt=\"A picturesque view of a mountainous village with snow-capped peaks in the background, green hills in the foreground, buildings scattered throughout, and a clear sky above.\"></p>\n<p>Here we have one of the first highlight landscapes: The Oberalp Pass, which is 2,033 meters above sea level.

In Lyon, the Rhône river passes through the city. The train route from Lyon to Geneva to Brig follows the Rhône river valley and we saw the headwaters of this river as well. So incredible! Not to mention the milky blue color of the water, which my train neighbor told me is due to the glacial melt water mixed with the mineral content of the mountains.</p>\n<p>The next highlight is the Rhine Gorge, which we are told is known as the &ldquo;Swiss Grand Canyon.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure about that comparison, but it was an incredible sight that stood out from the other landscapes. This photo really doesn&rsquo;t do it justice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3904f4a7-b24f-4829-9700-494b89e31941.jpg\" alt=\"A serene landscape featuring a turquoise river in the foreground with lush greenery on its banks and dramatic, rocky mountains in the background, all under a slightly cloudy sky.\"></p>\n<p>We had a short stop at a station to switch out engines.

It was built in 1902 and stands 65 meters tall. It is considered an architectural masterpiece. Again, the photos do not do it justice and, honestly, the best views would have been from outside the train rather than on it.

So, does it live up to the hype? Yes, I think so. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever experience anything quite like this anywhere else. The views were amazing. The train interior was over the top luxury. The service was great. The food, hands down the best I&rsquo;ve ever had on a mode of transportation. It was certainly high-end restaurant level of food.

It's excessively luxurious, but this is likely a once in a lifetime thing, so I thought it was worth the splurge. \n\n![A magazine cover titled \"EXCELLENCE MAGAZINE\" featuring a photograph of a stone bridge with a train crossing, with the caption \"Window to the Swiss Alps\" and the Glacier Express logo, indicating routes from St. Moritz/Davos - Zermatt.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0975b00a-a956-40e5-b3b2-49e0c96c915f.jpg)\n\nHere's a few facts and figures from the Excellence Magazine that was provided to us:\n\n* UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Jungfrau-Aletsch and Albula & Bernini Line \n* Route length: 291 kilometers\n* 291 bridges\n* 42 km/h avg speed\n* From 584 to 2,033 meters above sea level\n* 45 m^2 windows in each carriage\n* 91 tunnels\n* In operation since 1930\n* Steepest gradient: 12.5%\n* 31.9km cog wheel stretch\n\nBut forget the numbers, let's talk about the views. The landscapes quickly became impressive. A lot of the advertising shows this train in winter, but I'm glad that I was able to take it in the spring, as the green fields with wildflowers against the snow capped mountains made for stunning view after stunning view. \n\nI'm very sorry that these photos do not do it justice. You'll have to take my word for it. Or, better yet, come and experience the Glacier Express for yourself!\n\n![A vibrant field of yellow flowers with a backdrop of towering mountains and a clear blue sky, taken from behind a window as evidenced by light reflections visible across the image.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/80138c45-e13e-46f4-94c7-43b69fe70637.jpg)\n\n![A picturesque view of a mountainous village with snow-capped peaks in the background, green hills in the foreground, buildings scattered throughout, and a clear sky above.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ba699524-0d8d-4275-aa59-7dc9235efadb.jpg)\n\nHere we have one of the first highlight landscapes: The Oberalp Pass, which is 2,033 meters above sea level. Here you see the Oberalp Lake.\n\n![A glacier with a snow-covered surface featuring meltwater pools against a backdrop of mountain slopes and a clear blue sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/99994c68-eadc-47cd-851b-78707d1e2981.jpg)\n\nNear the pass is, surprisingly enough, this lighthouse. This lighthouse marks the source (well, one of) the Rhine river. It's a smaller scale exact copy of the lighthouse in Rotterdam where the Rhine meets the sea!\n\n![A red-roofed lighthouse-style building labeled \"Infocenter\" perched on a snow-covered landscape with mountainous terrain in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/73ae1744-887f-48c4-ac15-00cb760a2bf3.jpg)\n\nWhen I booked this trip, I did not expect to see the origin of these famous rivers. In Lyon, the Rhône river passes through the city. The train route from Lyon to Geneva to Brig follows the Rhône river valley and we saw the headwaters of this river as well. So incredible! Not to mention the milky blue color of the water, which my train neighbor told me is due to the glacial melt water mixed with the mineral content of the mountains. \n\nThe next highlight is the Rhine Gorge, which we are told is known as the \"Swiss Grand Canyon.\" I'm not sure about that comparison, but it was an incredible sight that stood out from the other landscapes. This photo really doesn't do it justice. \n\n![A serene landscape featuring a turquoise river in the foreground with lush greenery on its banks and dramatic, rocky mountains in the background, all under a slightly cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3904f4a7-b24f-4829-9700-494b89e31941.jpg)\n\nWe had a short stop at a station to switch out engines. So, I took an opportunity to photograph engine 626. \n\n![A red train locomotive with the number 626 parked at a train station, with mountains and a cloudy sky in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/19360b09-2887-4693-bc00-9eb6d602a61a.jpg)\n\nA few more scenic village views before our next highlight. \n\n![A serene landscape with a small church on a hill, plowed fields in the foreground, and snow-capped mountains in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9e87e2a0-56b0-4460-bbfd-da710c0acdec.jpg)\n\n![A picturesque village nestled at the base of a mountain range with a prominent peak against a blue sky with fluffy clouds. A road winds through vibrant green fields leading towards the village center, characterized by traditional buildings and a church with a tall steeple.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cefa65a8-11fe-4168-be22-c77d8aa9369b.jpg)\n\nThe final highlight on the trip is the Landwasser Viaduct. It was built in 1902 and stands 65 meters tall. It is considered an architectural masterpiece. Again, the photos do not do it justice and, honestly, the best views would have been from outside the train rather than on it. But I do think it was cool that we could catch a glimpse of the forward carriages of our train as we made the crossing. \n\n![A train crossing a tall, stone arch bridge against a backdrop of steep, rocky slopes and trees under a partly cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/42079c52-81df-4703-8d2a-3b0f0960c159.jpg)\n\nNot too long after the viaduct, we pulled into the platform at St. Moritz. \n\n![A red and white electric train at a platform with overhead power lines, a pantograph raised to connect with the electric supply, and other trains in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/01255c6f-a672-448c-b37c-1994d27e8f24.jpg)\n\nThank you, Glacier Express, for an incredible experience! So, does it live up to the hype? Yes, I think so. I don't think I'll ever experience anything quite like this anywhere else. The views were amazing. The train interior was over the top luxury. The service was great. The food, hands down the best I've ever had on a mode of transportation. It was certainly high-end restaurant level of food. And the wine pairings (all Swiss wines, I believe) were very good as well.\n\nThe view in St. Moritz immediately outside the train station.\n![A scenic view of a lake with a town in the foreground and snow-capped mountains in the background under a blue sky with clouds.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/47e152f0-9755-4a72-9d68-5d1fc276646b.jpg)\n\nAnd here's the view from my room. It's perfectly on theme for this whole trip and somewhat accidental, as I didn't realize it overlooked the station.\n![A train station with red trains, a lake, a forest, and snow-capped mountains in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/8a6c0442-c74e-4044-83a2-cb918809540a.jpg)\n\nTomorrow, I'll explore St. Moritz! I believe there's a cog railway up the mountain that I'll most likely visit.\n\nGoodnight!\n",

				"content_text": "\nWelcome back to another update from my [Europe Train Adventure](https://doug.pub/2024/05/18/europe-train-adventure.html).\n\nToday was the first high speed rail leg of my trip, starting at St. Pancras International station in London and arriving at Gare du Nord in Paris.\n\n![A person walking through an arched corridor with the sign \"St Pancras International\" on a brick wall, indicating a location within St Pancras railway station.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/8d91292d-7560-49b6-87f6-cc13c1b2d7aa.jpg)\n\nI enjoyed the architecture of St. Pancras station as I headed to board Eurostar 9022 to Paris. \n\n![A busy train station with a large clock, passengers with luggage, a departing train, and a glass and metal roof structure.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e35edab4-c7de-4fa8-9c61-523ccaee21c5.jpg)\n\n![Eurostar train at a station with a destination sign showing \"Paris.\"](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2c734194-0aa1-4c61-9333-278cbdeffc96.jpg)\n\nMy car for the journey. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious. I also appreciated how low key the boarding experience was. I was relaxing in my seat and without any fanfare we slowly started to depart the station.\n\n![Interior of a train carriage with passengers seated and overhead luggage compartments, featuring comfortable seats and a digital display indicating the destination as Paris.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7494c123-103c-48c4-9562-2f690c1159b3.jpg)\n\nThe high speed rail lived up to its name! That's about 182 mph. \n\n![A digital display inside a train showing the speed of 293 km/h and the destination \"Paris\" under the label \"Business Premier.\"](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/716aa7ef-9aeb-4f46-84ed-cbd749147cc0.jpg)\n\nThe trip felt quick too. We were practically to Paris by the time I was able to upload a photo and make a short post. My seat included food, which was served before we even entered the Chunnel. \n\nThe platform in Gare du Nord station.\n![The Gare du Nord train station interior with platforms, tracks, passengers with luggage, overhead signs for platforms 3 and 4, a stairway, and a glass and metal roof.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/1b5eb672-a9ad-4e8d-9457-6e7d873f0912.jpg)\n\nThe station exterior from the street. \n![A wide shot of the Gare du Nord train station in Paris with pedestrians walking in front, decorative banners, and a red sculpture near a lamppost.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/adbc551c-c433-4fcc-bdb3-5d323d5f8ac4.jpg)\n\nMy hotel is only a short walk from Gare du Nord. After checking in to my room, I decided to stroll around and I ended up walking along Canal Saint Martin.\n\n![A scenic view of a canal with clear water, bordered by a pedestrian walkway and a road with a few cars and cyclists. Trees and buildings line the opposite bank under a cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/43da869c-3ef7-412c-80c5-7b0ad2e390b9.jpg)\n\nSomething I noticed while walking around Paris is how many bikes there are and the numerous bike lanes and associated bike infrastructure. Many lanes on busier streets seemed protected from car traffic, which is great. Other European cities, such as Amsterdam, are famous for their biking, but I didn't realize Paris was this far along. I wish US cities would adopt this kind of bike infrastructure. There's an increasing number of people riding bikes in Atlanta, but we are especially far behind when it comes to bike infra! \n\nTomorrow, I'll do some sightseeing around Paris. Goodnight!\n",

And it pits them against another movement known as effective altruism  or &ldquo;EA&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The e/acc movement believes in unfettered technological progress, while the EA movement tends to espouse caution and, often, regulation.</p>\n<p>The whole OpenAI brouhaha seems like it might boil down to a conflict between these two movements.</p>\n<p>Reading this article, I get the feeling that my own beliefs are not well aligned with either movement. There&rsquo;s so many unknowns about the future of AI and its impact on humanity. But, if we assume that it is going to be another large technological leap forward, and a fundamental advancement in computation and human computer interaction, then it feels important to consider where the dominant movements driving AI forward will bring us. I fear, with either movement, if played out to their logical conclusions, might result in similar dystopian outcomes.</p>\n<p>The question I would want to consider in either movement is: &ldquo;Who owns the machine?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With e/acc&rsquo;s hyper-capitalist ideas, I think a limited set of corporations would own the means of operating advanced AI. Capitalism tends to concentrate wealth and power in a limited set of hands.</p>\n<p>With EA, it might be the government (and whatever limited companies they grant a license to). Regulation and strict control tend to also concentrate power in a few places.</p>\n<p>Either outcome seems bad.</p>\n<p>Compare this to earlier computer advancements that tended to <em>decentralize</em> innovation and control.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of the early days of the Web.

Personal computers, solving problems in the lives of everyday people.</p>\n<p>If AI is going to be as impactful as the Web and even the personal computer, I think we ought to consider how we can decentralize this advancement. What models allow for this technology to be owned and operated by everyone? What models tend to consolidate power into a few hands? What keeps the computer a tool that empowers the user, and what makes it a machine that enriches and empowers a select few?</p>\n",

And it pits them against another movement known as effective altruism  or \"EA\". \n\nThe e/acc movement believes in unfettered technological progress, while the EA movement tends to espouse caution and, often, regulation. \n\nThe whole OpenAI brouhaha seems like it might boil down to a conflict between these two movements. \n\nReading this article, I get the feeling that my own beliefs are not well aligned with either movement. There's so many unknowns about the future of AI and its impact on humanity. But, if we assume that it is going to be another large technological leap forward, and a fundamental advancement in computation and human computer interaction, then it feels important to consider where the dominant movements driving AI forward will bring us. I fear, with either movement, if played out to their logical conclusions, might result in similar dystopian outcomes.\n\nThe question I would want to consider in either movement is: \"Who owns the machine?\" \n\nWith e/acc's hyper-capitalist ideas, I think a limited set of corporations would own the means of operating advanced AI. Capitalism tends to concentrate wealth and power in a limited set of hands. \n\nWith EA, it might be the government (and whatever limited companies they grant a license to). Regulation and strict control tend to also concentrate power in a few places. \n\nEither outcome seems bad. \n\nCompare this to earlier computer advancements that tended to _decentralize_ innovation and control. \n\nI'm thinking of the early days of the Web. Or even earlier to the dawn of the personal computer, where [Laine Nooney’s book on the software ecosystem of the Apple II](https://www.lainenooney.com/the-apple-ii-age.html) shows a history where innovation via many independent developers, creating software that empowered entirely new industries. Personal computers, solving problems in the lives of everyday people. \n\nIf AI is going to be as impactful as the Web and even the personal computer, I think we ought to consider how we can decentralize this advancement. What models allow for this technology to be owned and operated by everyone? What models tend to consolidate power into a few hands? What keeps the computer a tool that empowers the user, and what makes it a machine that enriches and empowers a select few?\n  \n",
