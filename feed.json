The target was [Carolina cherry laurel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_caroliniana) which is considered invasive in this area, but native in the Carolinas. \n\nLater, I took the dogs for a walk around the trails of [Mason Mill](https://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/sites/default/files/users/user3571/Mason%20Mill%20Trail%20Map.pdf), which has some nice elevated boardwalks and trails that head off from it. \n\nHere's some photos of one of those trails that starts out running underneath the boardwalk. \n\n![A wooden bridge with visible support beams spans over a dirt pathway in a forest. The area is surrounded by trees with sparse foliage, and the ground is covered with fallen leaves and pine needles. The sky is clear and blue.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/827d4528-5d91-4885-8c33-85cb1ad252d6.jpg)\n\nThen it winds off away. \n\n![A narrow dirt trail winds through a woodland area with tall, leafless trees and some shrubs showing early signs of greenery. Sunlight filters through the branches, casting shadows on the path. The sky is clear and blue.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/3ac7d9b6-96c2-4b6f-9bac-99d7bc969a59.jpg)\n\nActive freight rail passes through the center of the park. \n\n![A train partially visible through a dense thicket of bare trees and branches, with a clear blue sky in the background. The scene captures the interplay of natural and man-made elements.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/d80fded0-34a6-4180-b51d-aa93bb9181ec.jpg)\n\n![Underneath view of a wooden bridge with beams and supports, spanning over a small creek. The surrounding area features exposed soil and vegetation with sunlight filtering through the branches.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/807dd34e-1b27-4733-aae1-47738d1f46ac.jpg)\n\nThis was my first time trying out these paths and it was fun to find two City Champion Trees, meaning they are the largest examples of the species in the greater Atlanta area. \n\n![A tall red maple tree stands prominently on a woodland path. Bare branches extend upward against a clear blue sky. A sign in the foreground reads \"City Champion Red Maple, Acer rubrum.\" Surrounding bushes and trees show early signs of foliage. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/62d2995c-4998-44c6-81f6-4f7105e7871f.jpg)\n\n![A large tree in a forested area with a sign in front. The sign reads \"City Champion River Birch\" with the scientific name \"Betula nigra.\" It lists measurements from 2021: 11‚Äô 2‚Äù circumference, 72.7‚Äô tall, 80‚Äô crown spread. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/8a5a7a8a-56f8-4435-870a-818c3338050f.jpg)\n\nA view from the boardwalk trail. \n\n![A calm, reflective pond bordered by dry, brown vegetation and tall, leafless trees against a clear blue sky. Sparse greenery is visible, adding to the winter landscape feel.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/8b7bcd58-9ba5-4a05-887a-ff1e4ccddd2a.jpg)\n\nLater, we met up with a friend to walk around [Murphy Candler Park](https://www.brookhavenga.gov/parksrec/park/murphey-candler-park). \n\n![Three people are smiling in an outdoor setting with leafless trees in the background. The person on the left has a beard and wears glasses and a blue cap. The person in the middle also wears glasses and a denim shirt. The person on the right has glasses on their head and is also wearing a denim shirt. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2025/47b38e4c-668b-405f-86d2-3d614e5ae012.jpg)\n\nFrom left to right we have: me, my partner Beth, and our friend Shubam. (Hi, Shubam!)\n\nIt was a great day! I'm feeling content that I was able to spend so much time outdoors. Easy access to nature, even right outside my door, is one of the things that I really enjoy about living in this city. \n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Hello and welcome to another travel report, this time on our short trip to the area around Apalachicola in Florida&rsquo;s panhandle with my wife and our two dogs.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been to Florida, you may have noticed that they like to give catchy names to their numerous coasts. Here is no different and is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Florida&rsquo;s forgotten coast.&rdquo; Sounds ominous, but in fact we found it beautiful and had a wonderful time. But it does live up to this name, at least in our experience during this trip: the crowds forgot to come! Typically, winter is the peak season for Florida, but we were pretty shocked to find that&rsquo;s not the case here, at least not this particular week in December. We had the beach to ourselves, and a few restaurants!</p>\n<p>We stayed about 25 minutes from Apalachicola at a location known as Indian Pass Beach which is a tiny peninsula adjacent to St. Vincent Island.</p>\n<p>Our first full day there was a bit cloudy, but it was still fairly warm and made for a nice walk on the beach with the dogs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0693.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A sandy path lined with palm trees leads toward an elevated structure near the beach.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0654.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A calm seascape with a distant tree-lined shore under a cloudy sky.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0651.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A large, gnarled piece of driftwood rests on a sandy beach beside a calm sea under an overcast sky.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0652.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A fluffy dog with a wagging tail walks on a sandy beach.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0667.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A small, weathered boat rests on a sandy beach near the water.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0661.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A sign for the St. Vincent Island Shuttle is displayed by the water, promoting trips and fishing charters.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0664.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person stands on a wooden dock overlooking a body of water, with another individual sitting by a small beached boat under a cloudy sky.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0670.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A dog is lying on a deserted beach under a cloudy sky.\"></p>\n<p>Lunch was at <a href=\"https://indianpassrawbar.com\">Indian Pass Raw Bar</a> where we had our first taste of the famous Apalachicola oyster. Here we had them raw and in a preparation they simply call baked, which is oysters on the half shell sprinkled with cheese and baked until brown. Both were great! I also really liked the steamed shrimp here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0738.jpeg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tray holds several opened oysters with a small cup of sauce on the side.\"></p>\n<p>Interestingly, ahead of the trip we learned about the harvesting of the wild oysters from Apalachicola Bay, or more accurately the lack thereof. The Bay has been closed for oyster harvesting since 2020 in order to allow the wild oysters and ecosystem time to recover after the BP oil spill and other recent negative impacts. Next year is the end of the initial prohibition, but it&rsquo;s unclear if the Bay will be reopened for harvesting so soon. So, where do all the local oysters come from in restaurants? Well, oyster farming is still allowed and I believe that makes up the local supply. Supposedly these farms are actually helping the ecosystem recover, as oysters tend to act like filters that help to remove impurities from the water. I do hope the Bay is given enough time to completely recover before wild harvesting resumes.</p>\n<p>After lunch, we headed to the <a href=\"https://www.visitgulf.com/listing/forgotten-coast-sea-turtle-center/245/\">Forgotten Coast Sea Turtle Center</a> and got tour by one of the volunteers. This center exists to help support the sea turtle population that nests on the beaches in the area. They are also acting as a sanctuary to a few (non-sea) turtles and tortoises which were mostly donated pets. Excitingly, we were able to sponsor a nest for the 2025 sea turtle season, which means we funded protective measures to be placed when a nest is discovered on the beach. Then, we&rsquo;ll get some info about the location of the nest and how it progresses throughout the incubation period. We might return next year to check on our nest! (Sorry, somehow forgot to take any photos at the Center!)</p>\n<p>It was nearing dinner time and we had learned that with the reduced crowds, it was best to get in early before restaurants closed. Our destination this evening: Hole in the Wall Seafood in Apalachicola.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0740.jpeg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A display of numerous hats on a wall is accompanied by a vintage-style poster and a shelf filled with small items.\"></p>\n<p>Here, of course, we had more raw oysters!

But first, a stop at Bayside Coffee.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0696.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A black and white photo depicts a sign for Bayside Coffee Co. next to a roadside with parked vehicles and trees in the background.\"></p>\n<p>When we arrived at the State Park, we learned dogs were not allowed on the beach.

We saw  more dolphins than people!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0757.jpeg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two bicycles are parked on a sandy beach near the ocean on a foggy day.\"></p>\n<p>That night, we returned to Apalachicola for dinner at Owl Cafe which was located in a really cool old building.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/4f3f2299-2b67-4e3c-b9e4-8bdea21e4edf.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A two-story building features the OWL CAFE sign, with ivy climbing its facade and a warmly lit entrance at night.\"></p>\n<p>Of course, we had more oysters here! The rest of the food was good too with the gumbo being the highlight of the meal for me.</p>\n<p>After dinner, we took the dogs for their evening walk before the moon rose and when we looked out at the waves breaking into the beach we thought our eyes were playing tricks on us. It looked like the waves were glowing as they broke. But as we watched in awe we realized it must be bioluminescence that was triggered by the motion of the waves! It was unexpected and incredible! There was so little light pollution that we could see this naturally occurring phenomenon. I&rsquo;ve only witnessed bioluminescent waters in one other place: the bio bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico. While I know that the dinoflagellates that produce the light are common in ocean water, I thought it was exceptionally rare that they are present in enough concentration for humans to see their light. So I was very shocked that they appeared to us on this nighttime walk! After a little research, I learned it can be more common than I realized in the Gulf waters. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t have the necessary equipment to photograph the effect (namely, a tripod).</p>\n<p>The next morning we had time for one last walk along the beach before our departure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0754.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A serene coastal sunset is viewed through silhouettes of palm trees and a wooden house.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f458203f9b.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A silhouette of a dog&rsquo;s head is captured against the backdrop of a bright, setting sun.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/fe0b1a2438.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A serene beach landscape is illuminated by a golden sunset over the ocean.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b14b149676.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Wooden posts adorned with colorful fabric stand in rows leading out into the calm sea from a sandy beach.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6dbf8aef57.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A serene beach scene with gentle waves under a clear blue sky.

The Bay has been closed for oyster harvesting since 2020 in order to allow the wild oysters and ecosystem time to recover after the BP oil spill and other recent negative impacts. Next year is the end of the initial prohibition, but it's unclear if the Bay will be reopened for harvesting so soon. So, where do all the local oysters come from in restaurants? Well, oyster farming is still allowed and I believe that makes up the local supply. Supposedly these farms are actually helping the ecosystem recover, as oysters tend to act like filters that help to remove impurities from the water. I do hope the Bay is given enough time to completely recover before wild harvesting resumes. \n\nAfter lunch, we headed to the [Forgotten Coast Sea Turtle Center](https://www.visitgulf.com/listing/forgotten-coast-sea-turtle-center/245/) and got tour by one of the volunteers. This center exists to help support the sea turtle population that nests on the beaches in the area. They are also acting as a sanctuary to a few (non-sea) turtles and tortoises which were mostly donated pets. Excitingly, we were able to sponsor a nest for the 2025 sea turtle season, which means we funded protective measures to be placed when a nest is discovered on the beach. Then, we'll get some info about the location of the nest and how it progresses throughout the incubation period. We might return next year to check on our nest! (Sorry, somehow forgot to take any photos at the Center!)\n\nIt was nearing dinner time and we had learned that with the reduced crowds, it was best to get in early before restaurants closed. Our destination this evening: Hole in the Wall Seafood in Apalachicola. \n\n![Auto-generated description: A display of numerous hats on a wall is accompanied by a vintage-style poster and a shelf filled with small items.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0740.jpeg)\n\nHere, of course, we had more raw oysters! I also tried the seafood gumbo which was good and piping hot. \n\n![Auto-generated description: A close-up view of several opened oysters on a surface, highlighting their shells and flesh in black and white.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0745.jpeg)\n\nThe next day, we decided to head over to St. George Island State Park with the dogs. But first, a stop at Bayside Coffee.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A black and white photo depicts a sign for Bayside Coffee Co. next to a roadside with parked vehicles and trees in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0696.jpg)\n\nWhen we arrived at the State Park, we learned dogs were not allowed on the beach. But that was fine, since it was pretty foggy and we wanted to explore other parts of the park.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A foggy beach scene features a lone figure in the distance, warning signs, and a flapping flag near a fenced walkway.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0699.jpg)\n\nWe decided to walk on a trail through the salt marsh, which ended up being beautiful in the fog.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A line of tall trees stands behind a sandy landscape with sparse vegetation.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0700.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A solitary tree stands against a misty, open landscape in a grayscale setting.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0710.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A fallen tree rests on sandy ground surrounded by tall grasses and misty woodland.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0725.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A foggy landscape features a dense forest of tall, leafless trees and overgrown grass.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0730.jpg)\n\nOn the way back through Apalachicola, we stopped for lunch at Up The Creek Raw Bar which is right beside the docks along the river. \n\n![Auto-generated description: A boat is docked at a wooden pier in a calm body of water.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0745.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A pile of colorful, weathered fishing buoys with a variety of shapes and sizes is scattered outdoors.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0748.jpg)\n\nThat afternoon, we rode bikes along the beach outside where we were staying. It was a surreal experience with the fog, the waves breaking right next to us, and the mostly empty beaches. We saw  more dolphins than people!\n\n![Auto-generated description: Two bicycles are parked on a sandy beach near the ocean on a foggy day.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/img-0757.jpeg)\n\nThat night, we returned to Apalachicola for dinner at Owl Cafe which was located in a really cool old building.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A two-story building features the OWL CAFE sign, with ivy climbing its facade and a warmly lit entrance at night.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/4f3f2299-2b67-4e3c-b9e4-8bdea21e4edf.jpg)\n\nOf course, we had more oysters here! The rest of the food was good too with the gumbo being the highlight of the meal for me.\n\nAfter dinner, we took the dogs for their evening walk before the moon rose and when we looked out at the waves breaking into the beach we thought our eyes were playing tricks on us. It looked like the waves were glowing as they broke. But as we watched in awe we realized it must be bioluminescence that was triggered by the motion of the waves! It was unexpected and incredible! There was so little light pollution that we could see this naturally occurring phenomenon. I've only witnessed bioluminescent waters in one other place: the bio bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico. While I know that the dinoflagellates that produce the light are common in ocean water, I thought it was exceptionally rare that they are present in enough concentration for humans to see their light. So I was very shocked that they appeared to us on this nighttime walk! After a little research, I learned it can be more common than I realized in the Gulf waters. Sadly, I didn't have the necessary equipment to photograph the effect (namely, a tripod). \n\nThe next morning we had time for one last walk along the beach before our departure.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A serene coastal sunset is viewed through silhouettes of palm trees and a wooden house.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dscf0754.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A silhouette of a dog's head is captured against the backdrop of a bright, setting sun.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f458203f9b.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A serene beach landscape is illuminated by a golden sunset over the ocean.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/fe0b1a2438.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: Wooden posts adorned with colorful fabric stand in rows leading out into the calm sea from a sandy beach.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b14b149676.jpg)\n\n![Auto-generated description: A serene beach scene with gentle waves under a clear blue sky.

Originally released in 1999, Shenmue is an open-world RPG/life simulation set in 1980s Japan. It was the most expensive game ever developed at the time and I think it shows.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When I originally played Shenmue, I remember being blown away by the level of detail and that every NPC has voiced dialogue (the English voice actors weren&rsquo;t great&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t think I cared much at the time). The world has a realistic day/night cycle and people and shops follow realistic patterns. Sometimes, you&rsquo;ll need to enter a shop or restaurant and it doesn&rsquo;t open until a certain time, but unlike a lot of modern games you can&rsquo;t enter a menu and pass the time. Instead, you must wait or kill time in game. Thankfully one of the early areas has an arcade where you can spend in-game money to play classic Sega games like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Harrier\">Space Harrier</a> (which was also developed by Shenmue&rsquo;s designer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Suzuki\">Yu Suzuki</a>).</p>\n<p>Playing Shenmue today, I think the graphics and game design holds up fairly well. But it&rsquo;s definitely a different approach to games of this type. The pace is slow. You have no choice but to be patient at times. There&rsquo;s also no map in the menus or HUD. Instead, you must find maps in the game world and figure out how to navigate from that. The controls feel a bit awkward, for some reason forcing you to use the d-pad for movement while the analog stick serves as a sort of first person view camera movement input.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s several more modern ways to play Shenmue, but I&rsquo;m happy that I can revisit the original on real hardware.

Originally released in 1999, Shenmue is an open-world RPG/life simulation set in 1980s Japan. It was the most expensive game ever developed at the time and I think it shows. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/488877-shenmue-dreamcast-screenshot-active-town-streets.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\">\n\nWhen I originally played Shenmue, I remember being blown away by the level of detail and that every NPC has voiced dialogue (the English voice actors weren't great...but I don't think I cared much at the time). The world has a realistic day/night cycle and people and shops follow realistic patterns. Sometimes, you'll need to enter a shop or restaurant and it doesn't open until a certain time, but unlike a lot of modern games you can't enter a menu and pass the time. Instead, you must wait or kill time in game. Thankfully one of the early areas has an arcade where you can spend in-game money to play classic Sega games like [Space Harrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Harrier) (which was also developed by Shenmue's designer, [Yu Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Suzuki)). \n\nPlaying Shenmue today, I think the graphics and game design holds up fairly well. But it's definitely a different approach to games of this type. The pace is slow. You have no choice but to be patient at times. There's also no map in the menus or HUD. Instead, you must find maps in the game world and figure out how to navigate from that. The controls feel a bit awkward, for some reason forcing you to use the d-pad for movement while the analog stick serves as a sort of first person view camera movement input. \n\nThere's several more modern ways to play Shenmue, but I'm happy that I can revisit the original on real hardware. And with the mods installed in my DC, it looks better than it ever did in 1999!\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Hello from Delta flight 67 Rome to Atlanta!</p>\n<p>Now that our time in Italy has wrapped up, I thought I&rsquo;d try to compile some thoughts on our overall experience in Italy. This was my first time traveling in Italy. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to visit for some time since I love Italian food and I have some heritage in Italy via my mother&rsquo;s side of the family (according to my DNA report, I&rsquo;m just under 25% genetically Italian heritage). And, for various reasons, the Italian culture is the one that has prevailed in my family&rsquo;s traditions. So, the trip was more meaningful to me than most.</p>\n<p>In short, our time in Italy was fantastic! The food and scenery both exceeded my expectations. The food especially just seems so much better than what we have access to in the US. Even simple, raw ingredients, like a tomato, tasted much better than anything I&rsquo;ve had before. And for more complex ingredients like olive oil and cheese, well, Italy is just producing stuff on another level compared to America. I&rsquo;m definitely returning home feeling inspired to do what I can to find local, fresh ingredients for meals at home.</p>\n<p>One experience that is really sticking with me is making pasta in our airbnb. The host provided the ingredients and suggested a simple preparation of just olive oil and cheese crumbled on top, which is what we did. We simply cooked the orecchiette in salted water, topped it with olive oil, salt, and crumbled cheese. We added fresh tomatoes as garnish. This dish was fantastic! And it took all of 15 minutes to prepare. I&rsquo;ve cooked a lot of pasta at home in the US and I&rsquo;ve never had something be so easy and incredibly delicious. There was no skill on our part, so the only explanation is really great ingredients.</p>\n<p>Looking back to the places we visited, in order: Rome, Florence, Tuscany, Puglia. I don&rsquo;t think I can pick a favorite. In fact, I think a highlight was visiting multiple regions and seeing the differences in food and culture. We learned about Italian history and how most cities (and the regions around them) were distinct with their own cultures and dialects until Italian unification in 1861. Even to this day, these regional differences carry on. We learned of a few different dialects and how different they are from one another. So, if you visit Italy, I&rsquo;d definitely suggest visiting a few regions to experience these differences.</p>\n<p>In Rome, we loved seeing the ancient Roman history in the Colosseum and Imperial Forum. It&rsquo;s amazing to have a view onto this ancient civilization and see the city they built. It&rsquo;s also incredible to think that Rome has been inhabited continuously since antiquity. We also enjoyed modern Rome, meaning it&rsquo;s a vibrant city beyond the touristy parts. This means you can find authentic, local food without too much trouble. Some of our favorite dishes were in Rome.</p>\n<p>Florence was amazing to see the art and the beautiful Renaissance era buildings and streets. If you stay in the central part of the city, it&rsquo;s very walkable. Florence is also very touristy, every street is filled with tourists. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, but is the reality of visiting the historic parts of Florence. The food can be great here too, we had one of the best meals of our trip here. So, it&rsquo;s certainly possible to avoid tourist traps and find great places.</p>\n<p>Tuscany was beautiful. Just driving through the countryside, or even better, biking through it, gives you so many scenic views. I enjoyed that we got to stay at a farmhouse and enjoy some agritourism while we were there. Visiting all the small Tuscany towns was very fun too, each one has its own unique history and feel to it. Of course, the food is great in Tuscany. We loved the handmade pici pasta, and had one of the best cacio e pepe dishes of our trip in Tuscany. The wine is great here too, and it was fun to visit a few vineyards and see exactly where the grapes came from.</p>\n<p>Finally, our time in Puglia was great as well. While both Puglia and Tuscany are heavily into agriculture, I think Puglia exceeds Tuscany in this regard, giving you access to fresh, local foods almost everywhere you go. In fact, many of the foods we had in Puglia were the best on our trip. We loved the bread (especially the focaccia), cheese, meats, and seafood here. Puglia is also a lot less touristy than Tuscany, especially if you get away from the coast and head inland. Our e-bike tour through Puglia was one of the best rides of my life. The Pugliese countryside is beautiful in its own, unique way. I also loved the cities rendered in white, from the cobblestone streets to the buildings. Puglia definitely felt as if it could have been a different country from Tuscany and the cities of Rome and Florence.</p>\n<p>So, overall the trip was great! I&rsquo;m already thinking about when we might be able to return to Italy. I&rsquo;m definitely going to miss the great food (and lack of humidity) after returning home!</p>\n<h2 id=\"housekeeping-and-thoughts-on-blogging\">Housekeeping and thoughts on blogging</h2>\n<p>Just a quick housekeeping note: I&rsquo;ve gone back and added categories to all these Travel Report posts to make it easier to find them and read any that were missed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://doug.pub/categories/italy-2024/\">Italy 2024</a> category for just the reports on Italy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doug.pub/categories/europe-train-journey-2024/\">Europe Train Journey 2024</a> category for the posts on my earlier <a href=\"https://doug.pub/2024/05/18/europe-train-adventure.html\">Europe Train Adventure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doug.pub/categories/travel-report/\">Travel Report</a> for every travel report posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find these categories and all my prior posts on the <a href=\"https://doug.pub/archive/\">Archive</a> page.</p>\n<p>This trip was the first time that I&rsquo;ve tried blogging about travel and I&rsquo;m very happy that I decided to do this.

				"content_html": "<p>Hello from Puglia, aboard the train headed to Rome. Puglia was the last leg of our trip in Italy, aside from tonight in Rome before we catch our flight back to Atlanta tomorrow.</p>\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s cover what we got into in Puglia!</p>\n<p>We stayed in a house just outside the city of Noci. It was a great property with beautiful gardens. It really felt like we were deep in the countryside even though we were a kilometer or two from town.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where we stayed.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/25d0ff9a-4995-4e87-b8b2-55d0eea22e77.jpg\" alt=\"A rustic stone house surrounded by trees and greenery. There is a small patio area with a metal table and chairs on the right. The ground is covered in gravel and there is an old wooden door on the house. The sky is partly cloudy.\"></p>\n<p>On our first full day, the main event was an e-bike tour around the Pugliese countryside. We started in Alberobello which is known for buildings with conical stacked stone roofs known as trulli. In fact, you can find these buildings all over Puglia, but they are concentrated in Alberobello, and some have been converted into shops and hotels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/885df7dc-7e3d-4c46-94b3-6f3fb2e3a004.jpg\" alt=\"This image shows a narrow street lined with traditional whitewashed stone houses featuring conical roofs, known as trulli, under a clear blue sky. The houses have small flower pots placed along the sidewalk. The overall scene is bright and tranquil.\"></p>\n<p>We spent some time here, seeing the trulli up close and we even were able to enter one. These buildings are often 100s of years old and very rustic. Living in them can be a hard life, since you don&rsquo;t have many modern comforts. We learned that for this reason, maybe 20-30 years ago, most people were trying to get out of Alberobello to live somewhere more modern. It wasn&rsquo;t until relatively recently that it became more of a tourist attraction and owning a trulli became more desirable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bc352d03-3f0a-4b50-ad01-7079de1c8111.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up view of a traditional trullo house with whitewashed stone walls and a conical roof made of stone slabs.

Everything was extremely delicious! I especially loved the focaccia we had in Puglia. Often it was made with a darker grain that gave it more flavor. I think the focaccia here is the best I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cfacd4e2-fd1b-4a3f-af96-bde52549f0f6.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a beard and a yellow cap sits at an outdoor table.

I recorded our route on <a href=\"https://strava.app.link/u5oBWkt7uKb\">Strava</a> if you are curious for more detail. At 50 kilometers, it was a long ride, but very fun!

The landscape around the town consists of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation.\"></p>\n<p>We learned the history of Matera, which is vast. The civilization originally started as cave dwellings carved into the rock cliffs along the stream. Over time, people built on top of the caves, adding stonework to create buildings. However, every building is at least partially carved into the rock. Many buildings have vast caves below them. At least, if you were well off you could afford to have a building above ground. Many of the poorer residents lived entirely in caves with no access to fresh air.</p>\n<p>What was shocking was to learn how by the 1950s the city was in very rough shape. There was no running water or electricity. All of the residents were living life as if it was still the 1800s. Malaria and other diseases ran rampant as it was impossible to maintain modern hygiene.</p>\n<p>The government eventually stepped in and evicted everyone from the historic part of the city, into new public houses that was constructed adjacent to the historic buildings. So, from the 1950s until about 1990, the historic buildings sat vacant. Our tour guide told us that at one point, the government considered just demolishing the historic city, but abandoned the idea when they determined the amount of dynamite needed would be too costly</p>\n<p>So, the city sat vacant until the 1990s. At this point, the government decided to try and create a tourist destination. Modern utilities were installed and buildings were rented out to businesses. But, things didn&rsquo;t really catch on until about 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>Now, the city is in full tourist mode, with Michelin star restaurants and 5 star hotels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/69ef0327-11a1-4b2f-a6b4-f63cfdcc2ccf.jpg\" alt=\"Historic stone buildings densely packed on a hillside under a cloudy sky.

I really loved this region of Italy. The countryside is beautiful, and we had some of the best food of our trip here. If you visit Italy, I&rsquo;d highly recommend Puglia. It can be a lot less touristy compared to Tuscany and gives you an opportunity for more authentic experience.</p>\n<p>So, we have tonight in Rome, then we&rsquo;ve reached the end of our time in Italy. It&rsquo;s been fantastic! I&rsquo;m happy that we were able to see the big attractions in Rome and Florence and then spend substantial time in the countrysides of Tuscany and Puglia. It&rsquo;ll be hard to leave Italy!</p>\n<p>Ciao!</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Hello from Puglia, aboard the train headed to Rome. Puglia was the last leg of our trip in Italy, aside from tonight in Rome before we catch our flight back to Atlanta tomorrow.\n\nSo, let's cover what we got into in Puglia! \n\nWe stayed in a house just outside the city of Noci. It was a great property with beautiful gardens. It really felt like we were deep in the countryside even though we were a kilometer or two from town. \n\nHere's where we stayed.\n![A rustic stone house surrounded by trees and greenery. There is a small patio area with a metal table and chairs on the right. The ground is covered in gravel and there is an old wooden door on the house. The sky is partly cloudy.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/25d0ff9a-4995-4e87-b8b2-55d0eea22e77.jpg)\n\nOn our first full day, the main event was an e-bike tour around the Pugliese countryside. We started in Alberobello which is known for buildings with conical stacked stone roofs known as trulli. In fact, you can find these buildings all over Puglia, but they are concentrated in Alberobello, and some have been converted into shops and hotels. \n\n![This image shows a narrow street lined with traditional whitewashed stone houses featuring conical roofs, known as trulli, under a clear blue sky. The houses have small flower pots placed along the sidewalk. The overall scene is bright and tranquil.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/885df7dc-7e3d-4c46-94b3-6f3fb2e3a004.jpg)\n\nWe spent some time here, seeing the trulli up close and we even were able to enter one. These buildings are often 100s of years old and very rustic. Living in them can be a hard life, since you don't have many modern comforts. We learned that for this reason, maybe 20-30 years ago, most people were trying to get out of Alberobello to live somewhere more modern. It wasn't until relatively recently that it became more of a tourist attraction and owning a trulli became more desirable. \n\n![A close-up view of a traditional trullo house with whitewashed stone walls and a conical roof made of stone slabs. The house features a chimney and an arched entrance covered with a curtain. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bc352d03-3f0a-4b50-ad01-7079de1c8111.jpg)\n\nUs on our tour bikes in Alberobello.\n\n![A bearded man and a woman, both wearing helmets and sunglasses, are posing with their bicycles in front of a traditional stone building with a conical roof.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/e84f7066-d661-41ea-bc9a-94fe9825ef92.jpg)\n\n![A scenic view of the traditional trulli houses in Alberobello, Italy.

We drank caff√® Lecce, which is espresso over ice with sweet almond syrup (more on this later). I'm glad we were introduced to this drink, because it's great! Especially on a hot day.\n\n![Image of a historical town square featuring a semi-circular colonnade with arches and a two-story building with balconies.

Everything was extremely delicious! I especially loved the focaccia we had in Puglia. Often it was made with a darker grain that gave it more flavor. I think the focaccia here is the best I've ever had. \n\n![A man with a beard and a yellow cap sits at an outdoor table.

I recorded our route on [Strava](https://strava.app.link/u5oBWkt7uKb) if you are curious for more detail. At 50 kilometers, it was a long ride, but very fun! One of the best rides of my life!\n\n![Strava map showing a 50-kilometer e-bike ride route around Puglia, Italy.

We learned how the different pens are used to group cows that are different stages of their milk production cycle. \n\n![A livestock farm with a dirt-covered ground, a large manure pile, and several weathered concrete structures.

One person, wearing a hairnet, suspenders, and shoe covers, looks at their phone. The other person, dressed in white protective clothing, including a hat, apron, and boots, holds cheese. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5ec1c195-d6c4-4792-b693-79b8e68036b6.jpg)\n\nHoping I got \"accidentally\" locked in the cheese aging room. \n\n![A storage room filled with shelves and racks holding various types and shapes of cheese.

He explained that you only need 3 things for cheese: milk, salt, and enzymes. \n\nFor this demonstration, he started with fresh cheese curds and added salt and hot water then began to mix and stretch it with a wooden pallet. \n\nHere the curds are being stirred with the added salt and water. \n\n![A group of people wearing hairnets and protective shoe covers are observing a cheesemaker demonstrate cheese-making.

The instructor is handling fresh cheese curds, pulling them into a stretchy mass.

Here's Beth making burrata, which is stretchy mozzarella filled with stracciatella (strips of mozzarella\tand cream). We got to eat what we made and it was the best! So fresh and flavorful. I've never had burrata this good before. \n\n![Two individuals are engaged in a cheesemaking process in a dairy facility. They are wearing hygienic hairnets and aprons.

We ended up eating the lobster and scorpion fish. \n\n![A platter of fresh seafood, including various types of fish and a lobster with rubber bands around its claws, is displayed on a white tablecloth in an outdoor dining setting with a sea view in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7c59e8df-5416-46cd-9724-3de80179149d.jpg)\n\nSunset at Capitolo was very pretty!\n\n![A coastal scene at sunset featuring a rocky shoreline.

Shops on both sides display various items, including signs for \"APULIA.\" People stroll along the cobblestone path under a clear blue sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c2e3ec7b-03f7-4683-b3e6-370b4f56b45f.jpg)\n\nA cool portal onto the harbor. \n\n![View from a stone archway showing three people looking out at a harbor with boats.

I love the white render buildings and the white stone streets. \n\n![The image shows an old stone building with a tower, featuring intricate architectural details, standing under a clear blue sky. The building appears to be historical, possibly a church or an ancient structure.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ec324f2a-ded6-44ba-ab71-08c269009b94.jpg)\n\n![A narrow, sunlit alleyway in an old town with whitewashed buildings and stone walls.

The drink is named after the city of Lecce and is served as espresso with a side of almond syrup and ice. \n\n![The image shows a glass of almond syrup with ice, a cup of espresso on a saucer with a spoon, and a bottle of water labeled \"Ferrarelle.\" They are placed on a beige perforated table.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f74ad951-7af3-46bd-9d62-01162aa07f3a.jpg)\n\nYou pour the espresso into the glass, letting the cup rest upside down to make sure every drop of espresso makes it in. \n\n![A white coffee cup is placed upside down inside a glass filled with a two-layered liquid, coffee and almond syrup.

I love this drink. I'll have to try and find the right kind of almond syrup in the US so I can make this at home. \n\n![A glass of iced coffee sits next to an empty white coffee cup with a spoon inside on a perforated beige table.

Here we had a boat tour, which was a great way to see the coast.\n\n\nBeth gets the photo credit for all the pics from the boat. \n\n![View of coastal caves and rocky cliffs with blue-green water in the foreground.

The water inside was beautiful\n\n![A small boat navigating close to a rocky cliff with a shallow cave. The water is clear and turquoise, reflecting the surrounding rocks.

There's even a statue of him that we saw from the boat. However, our guide told us that the statue and celebration of Domenico is just for the tourists and the people from Polignano don't like the signer because he claimed to be from Sicily rather than his true birthplace of Polignano a Mare. \n\n![A charming evening street scene in an Italian town. Decorative lights hang above, displaying the words \"VOLARE OH OH\" and a musical note.

We were lucky enough to meet the cheese maker himself, Vito Dicecca, who was very nice. He stopped by our table a few times to chat with us and see what we thought of his cheese. We tasted a lot of cheese, and they were all great, but his signature blue cheese served as a cake topped with cherry was the star!\n\n![A slice of cake topped with berries is on a speckled cake stand, accompanied by a fork. There is a wine bottle in the background.

The landscape around the town consists of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5d1b46cf-b7c0-4412-a335-65ce505a0ded.jpg)\n\nWe learned the history of Matera, which is vast. The civilization originally started as cave dwellings carved into the rock cliffs along the stream. Over time, people built on top of the caves, adding stonework to create buildings. However, every building is at least partially carved into the rock. Many buildings have vast caves below them. At least, if you were well off you could afford to have a building above ground. Many of the poorer residents lived entirely in caves with no access to fresh air. \n\nWhat was shocking was to learn how by the 1950s the city was in very rough shape. There was no running water or electricity. All of the residents were living life as if it was still the 1800s. Malaria and other diseases ran rampant as it was impossible to maintain modern hygiene. \n\nThe government eventually stepped in and evicted everyone from the historic part of the city, into new public houses that was constructed adjacent to the historic buildings. So, from the 1950s until about 1990, the historic buildings sat vacant. Our tour guide told us that at one point, the government considered just demolishing the historic city, but abandoned the idea when they determined the amount of dynamite needed would be too costly\n\n\nSo, the city sat vacant until the 1990s. At this point, the government decided to try and create a tourist destination. Modern utilities were installed and buildings were rented out to businesses. But, things didn't really catch on until about 10 years ago. \n\nNow, the city is in full tourist mode, with Michelin star restaurants and 5 star hotels.\n\n![Historic stone buildings densely packed on a hillside under a cloudy sky.

The architecture features a mix of arches, stairs, and balconies with weathered textures.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/69ef0327-11a1-4b2f-a6b4-f63cfdcc2ccf.jpg)\n\nHowever, it can be a surprising mix, as you'll pass buildings and areas of the city that still look completely abandoned and right next door is a swanky hotel. \n\n![A historic stone structure with a weathered, rustic appearance. The image shows a series of stone steps, lush greenery, and flowering plants in the foreground. Buildings with arched doorways and small windows are present, and the stone walls have plants growing. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c1cb94f2-c9cc-4b10-85b3-2c5f5cc27e13.jpg)\n\n![An ancient stone courtyard with weathered buildings featuring arched and rectangular doorways and windows.

I found Matera to be so fascinating and intriguing. It's hard to fathom that people have been living here for so long and how hard that life must have been. \n\n![View of the ancient city of Matera in Italy, featuring a dense cluster of historic stone buildings with tiled roofs and narrow streets.

I really loved this region of Italy. The countryside is beautiful, and we had some of the best food of our trip here. If you visit Italy, I'd highly recommend Puglia. It can be a lot less touristy compared to Tuscany and gives you an opportunity for more authentic experience. \n\nSo, we have tonight in Rome, then we've reached the end of our time in Italy. It's been fantastic! I'm happy that we were able to see the big attractions in Rome and Florence and then spend substantial time in the countrysides of Tuscany and Puglia. It'll be hard to leave Italy! \n\nCiao!\n\n",

This was outside Montefollonico with views of Montepulciano in the distance. \n\nIt was like a fairytale! \n\n![A rustic stone house surrounded by lush greenery and flowering plants, set against a backdrop of rolling hills and a clear blue sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2e26bf95-37b9-41d6-af3a-a4090c3b7b56.jpg)\n\n![A lush, green landscape featuring dense foliage in the foreground, with various plants and trees.

In the background, a person in a colorful skirt and sandals stands on the lawn. Flowering plants and greenery surround the area.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7f945454-924d-40d8-98c3-f3d8b64043dc.jpg)\n\nHere's the view of Montepulciano. \n\n![A scenic landscape featuring rolling green hills, yellow flowering bushes, and a distant hilltop town under a partly cloudy sky. Trees and shrubs dot the foreground, and a wooden fence lines part of the scene.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7525033f-375a-4e7d-897f-f1b9a3402fef.jpg)\n\nOn our first full day, we set out to explore the countryside around Montepulciano by e-bike. This region is famous for its wine production and beautiful medieval and Renaissance era town. \n\n![The image features an old cylindrical stone building with small windows and visible brickwork repairs. It is situated beside a road with a cypress tree on the left and is framed by a clear blue sky. A set of stone steps leads to the entrance. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a3a2c92d-c417-48cd-8299-8588f14da333.jpg)\n\n![View of a narrow street in an old town, flanked by historic buildings with stone facades.

At first, I was skeptical that we'd need a mountain bike. By the end, I realized why. Some of our route was on essentially farm roads that could be gravel and fairly rough. Even with an e-bike, the hills here are a challenge!\n\n![A person stands next to a mountain bike on a gravel path with a scenic view in the background. The individual is wearing a helmet and casual attire.

On the right side of the road, there is an old, rustic stone building with a tiled roof, and a tall, narrow cypress tree stands nearby. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/966b38d5-d970-48b0-b2c7-e974da00d655.jpg)\n\nThe route the bike shop provided included some stops for wine tasting. I loved how informal it was here at Boscarelli. These vineyards really are small operations. \n\n![A rustic wooden table with various items, including wine bottles, glasses, papers, and a smartphone case. Shelves and boxes containing books, wine packaging, and other items surround the table.

The tower is situated next to a winding road with trees and vegetation nearby.

We are beginning to see the pattern that Tuscan towns are built on the hilltops, creating great views of the landscapes. \n\n![A scenic landscape featuring a lush, green valley with rows of olive trees and dense forest-covered hills. Scattered houses are visible, nestled among the trees, and mountains can be seen in the distance under a clear sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b7e7b128-83a5-44c4-9bb0-b4de100dae4e.jpg)\n\nWe visited another winery and agriturismo. This one, called Fattoria del Colle is run by women. Again, it's a small operation. \n\n![This image shows the interior of a winery cellar with various barrels and tanks used for storing and aging wine. There are large wooden barrels, a ceramic fermentation tank, and stainless steel vats. The space features brick arches, rustic decorations, and industrial elements. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/9b49b8c2-b2a9-4c7d-9c03-85a8584619ff.jpg)\n\nMore great views. \n\n![Rolling countryside with green fields and wooded areas under a cloudy sky.

It was really fun to learn about the process, seeing the older machinery (big granite wheels) alongside the newer (centrifuges that reduce contact with air). \n\n\n![An olive oil mill facility with machinery including a granite millstone crusher, a metal conveyor, and various stainless steel processing units. The floor is tiled, and the room is well-lit with overhead fluorescent lights.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/13fbcb02-895a-4a8f-bd96-fc1b495c7dfe.jpg)\n\nThis small, family run operation puts out some great olive oil!\n\n\n![The image shows a display of various bottles of extra virgin olive oil on a small wooden table. The bottles are of different sizes and have different colored caps.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/61faaac2-f26f-40de-a4fd-cdf0719186ba.jpg)\n\nThey make several D.O.P. oils and this cloth details the Siena D.O.P. region. \n\n![A detailed cloth map depicts the production area for D.O.P.

In front of the church, a white marble statue depicts a robed figure standing on a stone pedestal.

I thought the streets here were very photogenic. \n\n![A person stands in the middle of a narrow, cobblestone alleyway flanked by tall, ancient stone buildings with green shutters.

Some (most?) date back to the Etruscan civilization. However, the walls have been reinforced and rebuilt over the centuries. \n\n![A historical stone archway with a medieval crest above it, situated in a rustic town. Black, white, and grey flags are draped over the wall.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/03b62352-8b06-417d-a8ff-176c7fa42d5a.jpg)\n\nDinner in a castle?

We learned about the documentary called Spettacolo that's about the theatrical event put on in the town square every year. We definitely will have to give this a watch!\n\n![A historic stone archway leads into a cobblestone street lined with old buildings.

Thanks for reading through the post. We absolutely loved our time there and would go back in a heartbeat. \n\nBut Puglia was calling.

In the background, there are arched structures, a blue construction tent, and trees. The sky is overcast. \"></p>\n<p>So, I think now is a good time to reflect on the overall trip. There&rsquo;s so much novel for me in this trip: new countries, new modes of transportation. Despite how unfamiliar I was with all of this, I think things went extremely smoothly. My trains all ran on schedule and I was able to complete each leg of the journey without a hitch.</p>\n<p>Knowing what I know now, would I recommend trains, especially high speed trains, as a mode of travel between European cities? Absolutely. For me, traveling like this is just so much more relaxed than flying. If it&rsquo;s realistic to take a train, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d go in the future.</p>\n<p>I really wish high speed rail would come to America. I think it enables a type of travel that isn&rsquo;t really possible without it.</p>\n<p>Ok, now for some highlights.</p>\n<p>Favorite train: Glacier Express. How could I not choose this? It was just over the top in every way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5aa6800a-bb7c-47e3-8aeb-a166cbe824fa.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows the interior of the Glacier Express train with spacious seating, large windows providing scenic views of lush greenery, houses, and mountains in the background. The seats are arranged around a central table, with clear glasses placed on top. The train has a luxurious\"></p>\n<p>Favorite non-scenic train: Eurostar from London to Paris. This train had the nicest cabin and best service. Oh and not that this train isn&rsquo;t scenic, the French countryside was beautiful, once you get through the darkness of the Chunnel. The only negative of the Eurostar is having to go through airport like security and passport control. But that&rsquo;s all about Britain and the EU and not the train&rsquo;s fault. But it&rsquo;s notable that this is the only time I&rsquo;ve had to go through security and passport checks like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2350e423-e1a9-48fe-a0f2-db466ab35a75.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of the Eurostar high-speed train car with business class seating. The seats are arranged in pairs, upholstered in grey with yellow accents. Overhead luggage racks hold various bags and suitcases. Digital screens display information about the destination, which is Paris. Pass\"></p>\n<p>Favorite stop: Zermatt, Switzerland. Seeing the Matterhorn both just from the streets of Zermatt where it seems to loom over the town as well as from mountain top via the gondola was absolutely incredible. From my experience, Switzerland is just an incredible country. So beautiful in many regards. I&rsquo;m looking forward to returning someday.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/d9f8211f-aa03-4733-addb-67eb17fcf0aa.jpg\" alt=\"A picturesque mountain landscape showcasing the snow-capped Matterhorn under a clear blue sky. The foreground features lush green hills and a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees.\"></p>\n<p>Favorite city: Lyon, France. Historic and beautiful Vieux Lyon, good food, bike friendly. I&rsquo;d like to return and spend more time here!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6e4525a9-1eca-46fe-9d11-f6b87a01ccf6.jpg\" alt=\"Lyon, France, showing the S√¥ane river with a motorboat passing under a concrete bridge. The bridge has streetlights and connects urban areas with historic buildings and dense greenery on the riverbanks. The sky is partly cloudy with blue patches.\"></p>\n<p>Favorite train station: This is harder as I didn&rsquo;t spend too much time in the stations&hellip;but I think it goes to St. Pancras in London. I loved all the glass ceilings and how it seems to mix modern and classic architecture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a9b138ec-9ca2-4f0d-b761-9d5ff6b874c6.jpg\" alt=\"The image shows the St. Pancras train station platform with people boarding a blue train. The station has a large, intricate arched roof made of steel and glass. A clock is prominently displayed above an entrance with a neon sign beneath it.\"></p>\n<p>So, what next? Here in Rome, I&rsquo;ll be linking up with my wife and we will travel around Italy. I arrived first due to her flight being delayed. (Hahah, train wins!)</p>\n<p>I think this will conclude the daily travel reports. But I will try to post some highlights from each part of Italy. We will be staying a few days in Rome, Florence, the Tuscany countryside, then all the way down in Puglia outside Bari, finally back to Rome for our flight home. We will be taking trains to travel from Rome -&gt; Florence and then Florence -&gt; Bari. We looked into flights for the Florence -&gt; Bari leg, but we really couldn&rsquo;t find anything that made more sense than the train.</p>\n<p>So, thank you very much for reading and following along with my trip! It&rsquo;s been really incredible. I feel so lucky to have seen so many countries, cities, and sights along the way. I&rsquo;m glad I could share some of it with you all here.</p>\n<p>Ciao!</p>\n",

There's so much novel for me in this trip: new countries, new modes of transportation. Despite how unfamiliar I was with all of this, I think things went extremely smoothly. My trains all ran on schedule and I was able to complete each leg of the journey without a hitch. \n\nKnowing what I know now, would I recommend trains, especially high speed trains, as a mode of travel between European cities? Absolutely. For me, traveling like this is just so much more relaxed than flying. If it's realistic to take a train, that's how I'd go in the future. \n\nI really wish high speed rail would come to America. I think it enables a type of travel that isn't really possible without it. \n\nOk, now for some highlights.\n\nFavorite train: Glacier Express. How could I not choose this? It was just over the top in every way.\n\n![The image shows the interior of the Glacier Express train with spacious seating, large windows providing scenic views of lush greenery, houses, and mountains in the background. The seats are arranged around a central table, with clear glasses placed on top. The train has a luxurious](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5aa6800a-bb7c-47e3-8aeb-a166cbe824fa.jpg)\n\n\nFavorite non-scenic train: Eurostar from London to Paris. This train had the nicest cabin and best service. Oh and not that this train isn't scenic, the French countryside was beautiful, once you get through the darkness of the Chunnel. The only negative of the Eurostar is having to go through airport like security and passport control. But that's all about Britain and the EU and not the train's fault. But it's notable that this is the only time I've had to go through security and passport checks like this.\n\n![Interior of the Eurostar high-speed train car with business class seating. The seats are arranged in pairs, upholstered in grey with yellow accents. Overhead luggage racks hold various bags and suitcases. Digital screens display information about the destination, which is Paris. Pass](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/2350e423-e1a9-48fe-a0f2-db466ab35a75.jpg)\n\nFavorite stop: Zermatt, Switzerland. Seeing the Matterhorn both just from the streets of Zermatt where it seems to loom over the town as well as from mountain top via the gondola was absolutely incredible. From my experience, Switzerland is just an incredible country. So beautiful in many regards. I'm looking forward to returning someday.\n\n![A picturesque mountain landscape showcasing the snow-capped Matterhorn under a clear blue sky. The foreground features lush green hills and a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/d9f8211f-aa03-4733-addb-67eb17fcf0aa.jpg)\n\nFavorite city: Lyon, France. Historic and beautiful Vieux Lyon, good food, bike friendly. I'd like to return and spend more time here!\n\n![Lyon, France, showing the S√¥ane river with a motorboat passing under a concrete bridge. The bridge has streetlights and connects urban areas with historic buildings and dense greenery on the riverbanks. The sky is partly cloudy with blue patches.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6e4525a9-1eca-46fe-9d11-f6b87a01ccf6.jpg)\n\nFavorite train station: This is harder as I didn't spend too much time in the stations...but I think it goes to St. Pancras in London. I loved all the glass ceilings and how it seems to mix modern and classic architecture. \n\n![The image shows the St. Pancras train station platform with people boarding a blue train. The station has a large, intricate arched roof made of steel and glass. A clock is prominently displayed above an entrance with a neon sign beneath it.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a9b138ec-9ca2-4f0d-b761-9d5ff6b874c6.jpg)\n\nSo, what next? Here in Rome, I'll be linking up with my wife and we will travel around Italy. I arrived first due to her flight being delayed. (Hahah, train wins!)\n\nI think this will conclude the daily travel reports. But I will try to post some highlights from each part of Italy. We will be staying a few days in Rome, Florence, the Tuscany countryside, then all the way down in Puglia outside Bari, finally back to Rome for our flight home. We will be taking trains to travel from Rome -> Florence and then Florence -> Bari. We looked into flights for the Florence -> Bari leg, but we really couldn't find anything that made more sense than the train.\n\nSo, thank you very much for reading and following along with my trip! It's been really incredible. I feel so lucky to have seen so many countries, cities, and sights along the way. I'm glad I could share some of it with you all here.\n\nCiao!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Hello from Milan, Italy! I&rsquo;ve reached the final country on my trek and I&rsquo;ve arrived via another world class train line. Today&rsquo;s star was the Bernina Express, which travels between St. Moritz and Tirano, Italy. This line is named after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernina_Pass\">Bernina Pass</a> through the Alps.</p>\n<p>In the last few days, I had been seeing snow in the forecast for St. Moritz. I spoke about the forecasted snow with a few people working at my hotel and they were skeptical that it would snow there this time of year.</p>\n<p>So, this morning when I woke up and looked out my window&hellip;sure enough the snow was falling!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/41e1fd95-39ab-4d38-a03f-3aa87afbc00e.jpg\" alt=\"Snow falling over a train station with red trains and a building in the foreground. Trees and a lake are visible in the misty background.\"></p>\n<p>Staff in the hotel continued to tell me this is very abnormal for St. Moritz this time of year. I&rsquo;ll take them at their word and believe that I must be very lucky then to have a train ride in snow today.</p>\n<p>And it really did make the passing forests look like a winter wonderland.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f67100ae-b41a-4f40-85ec-af91045575e3.jpg\" alt=\"A serene forest scene with evergreen trees covered in a light layer of snow. The ground is also lightly dusted with snow, creating a calm winter atmosphere. The sky is overcast, and snow is gently falling.\"></p>\n<p>Sure, we couldn&rsquo;t see the mountains or valleys that we&rsquo;d normally see on this route, but I think it was worth it to get a taste of winter in Switzerland. A few passengers sitting nearby agreed it was our lucky day.</p>\n<p>After about an hour into the trip, we stopped so passengers could exit and take photos. We were told this is a very scenic location. I&rsquo;ll just have to assume that&rsquo;s true.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b3709644-c92a-4aa7-98ff-57a784dbe014.jpg\" alt=\"A snowy landscape with evergreen trees and sparse bushes. The ground and trees are lightly covered in snow, creating a serene, wintry scene. The sky is overcast, and snowfall can be seen in the background.\"></p>\n<p>Since we really couldn&rsquo;t see anything much in the distance, I decided to photograph the snowy train instead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5de33f5a-b460-466b-afce-d4d35a803882.jpg\" alt=\"A red, snow-covered train car with large windows, labeled &ldquo;Bernina Express,&rdquo; is stopped in a snowy landscape.

The map uses color coding to indicate different temperature zones. Snow is indicated in a ring around St. Moritz. \"></p>\n<p>As we traveled along, one of the notable sights was this 360 degree spiral viaduct. I always enjoy when the curve is tight enough to see the cars ahead of us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/56bc433c-5784-42ed-bf6d-2d30c1b34e16.jpg\" alt=\"A red train traveling over a stone viaduct surrounded by lush, green landscape and hills. The foreground features a rail, and the image is slightly blurred and streaked, possibly due to raindrops on the camera lens.\"></p>\n<p>Shortly after the viaduct, we arrived in Tirano, Italy! The Bernina Express describes itself as &ldquo;from glaciers to palms&rdquo; and sure enough I did see palm trees in Tirano!

				"content_text": "Hello from Milan, Italy! I've reached the final country on my trek and I've arrived via another world class train line. Today's star was the Bernina Express, which travels between St. Moritz and Tirano, Italy. This line is named after the [Bernina Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernina_Pass) through the Alps. \n\nIn the last few days, I had been seeing snow in the forecast for St. Moritz. I spoke about the forecasted snow with a few people working at my hotel and they were skeptical that it would snow there this time of year. \n\nSo, this morning when I woke up and looked out my window...sure enough the snow was falling!\n\n![Snow falling over a train station with red trains and a building in the foreground. Trees and a lake are visible in the misty background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/41e1fd95-39ab-4d38-a03f-3aa87afbc00e.jpg)\n\nStaff in the hotel continued to tell me this is very abnormal for St. Moritz this time of year. I'll take them at their word and believe that I must be very lucky then to have a train ride in snow today. \n\nAnd it really did make the passing forests look like a winter wonderland. \n\n![A serene forest scene with evergreen trees covered in a light layer of snow. The ground is also lightly dusted with snow, creating a calm winter atmosphere. The sky is overcast, and snow is gently falling.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f67100ae-b41a-4f40-85ec-af91045575e3.jpg)\n\nSure, we couldn't see the mountains or valleys that we'd normally see on this route, but I think it was worth it to get a taste of winter in Switzerland. A few passengers sitting nearby agreed it was our lucky day.\n\nAfter about an hour into the trip, we stopped so passengers could exit and take photos. We were told this is a very scenic location. I'll just have to assume that's true.\n\n![A snowy landscape with evergreen trees and sparse bushes. The ground and trees are lightly covered in snow, creating a serene, wintry scene. The sky is overcast, and snowfall can be seen in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b3709644-c92a-4aa7-98ff-57a784dbe014.jpg)\n\nSince we really couldn't see anything much in the distance, I decided to photograph the snowy train instead. \n\n![A red, snow-covered train car with large windows, labeled \"Bernina Express,\" is stopped in a snowy landscape. Snowflakes are visible in the air, and the setting appears to be a cold, wintry environment.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5de33f5a-b460-466b-afce-d4d35a803882.jpg)\n\n![A red train is traveling through a snowy landscape. The tracks and the surrounding area are covered with snow. Overhead, electric lines span above the train, and a hill with some buildings is visible in the background under a light snowfall.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/31478463-0ff9-48b1-94a3-6b0e5de519af.jpg)\n\n![A person wearing a hooded jacket and smiling while taking a selfie in a snowy setting. Behind them, there is a red and white Bernina Express train. Snow is visibly falling and accumulating on the person's clothing and beard.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/6fec3645-3bb4-49f3-ba94-1c4b281fb396.jpg)\n\nWhen we got underway again and slowly began our decent, the snow turned to rain and the forests became more dense and green. \n\n![A scenic landscape featuring lush green fields, winding paths, and a few scattered houses, all set against a backdrop of forested hills partially obscured by fog and mist.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3536e2a4-9ef0-40d2-b6b1-3e9a0854fb9c.jpg)\n\nLooking at the weather radar, it the snow really seemed to be isolated just to the area around St. Moritz.\n\n![A weather map showing temperature gradients in a region that includes cities like Davos, St. Moritz, and Livigno. The map uses color coding to indicate different temperature zones. Snow is indicated in a ring around St. Moritz. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/19aa4b55-711e-4e79-ae66-01484d7751a1.jpg)\n\nAs we traveled along, one of the notable sights was this 360 degree spiral viaduct. I always enjoy when the curve is tight enough to see the cars ahead of us. \n\n![A red train traveling over a stone viaduct surrounded by lush, green landscape and hills. The foreground features a rail, and the image is slightly blurred and streaked, possibly due to raindrops on the camera lens.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/56bc433c-5784-42ed-bf6d-2d30c1b34e16.jpg)\n\nShortly after the viaduct, we arrived in Tirano, Italy! The Bernina Express describes itself as \"from glaciers to palms\" and sure enough I did see palm trees in Tirano! What a ride to go from the snow to palm trees in about 2 hours. \n\nI thought it was interesting that the Bernina Express basically runs right through the heart of this small town, almost operating as a street car. When you exit, you are in a small square. Here's the building that serves as the entrance to the railway to Switzerland.\n\n![A person in an orange jacket standing at the entrance of a building adorned with Italian and European Union flags.

				"title": "Travel Report Special Edition: How I packed for 1 month",
				"content_html": "<p>There&rsquo;s some interest in how I packed for this trip, so here&rsquo;s a post about that. (Hi, Su!)</p>\n<p>I knew I needed to develop a packing strategy ahead of the trip so I could be away for about a month. I also had a few other goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a carry-on sized bag so I wouldn&rsquo;t need to check it and it&rsquo;d more easily be stowed on trains</li>\n<li>Ideally a backpack so I&rsquo;m not lugging a roller down cobblestone streets or something like that. Plus it would be nice to have both hands free</li>\n<li>Enough organization to keep clean and dirty clothes separated. Plus have my bag not turn into a sloppy nightmare after living out of it for a month. Since for a good portion of the trip I&rsquo;d be in the same spot for only 2 nights, repacking and staying organized should be easy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in anticipation for this trip, I got a <a href=\"https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-42l-travel-pack\">Cotopaxi Allpa 42L travel pack</a>.</p>\n<p>What appealed to me about this is that it opens suitcase style and has some organization but not too much. So more pockets than a duffle bag, but not excessively compartmentalized.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also a backpack first and includes a hip belt, which has been great and I&rsquo;d highly recommend a hip belt for a bag this size.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/745b8e68-8fc9-4c51-aa18-f358aa7ea628.jpg\" alt=\"An open suitcase on a bed with neatly organized clothes and a pair of shoes beside it. The suitcase contains various clothing items including shirts and pants, and utilizes packing cubes for organization.\"></p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm organizing the bag:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main compartment\n<ul>\n<li>jackets and nicer shirts in the bottom of the main compartment folded simply to not be too thick</li>\n<li>packing cubes on top of those\n<ul>\n<li>small packing cube (top): underwear and socks</li>\n<li>large packing cube (bottom): pants, shorts, t-shirts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Top left small compartment\n<ul>\n<li>packable day bag</li>\n<li>travel towel</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bottom left mid-size compartment\n<ul>\n<li>Beach stuff (bathing suits, beach shirts)</li>\n<li>Extra shoes and sandals</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>small compartment on the face of the bag (which is face down on the bed)\n<ul>\n<li>My dopp kit</li>\n<li>Some small items like power adapters and battery</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s everything stowed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/97ccd205-3cf9-45f0-a498-8bbb1eab9a64.jpg\" alt=\"An open travel backpack with clothing items visible through their mesh tops, lying on a textured gray blanket with a yellow patterned sheet underneath.\"></p>\n<p>And here&rsquo;s the bag all zipped up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7b09ce09-556d-41dd-b82f-839050851fff.jpg\" alt=\"A blue travel backpack with a silhouette of an alpaca on it, placed on a gray knitted blanket over a patterned sheet.\"></p>\n<p>Packed like this it weighs 24.6 lbs.</p>\n<p>While I got this bag in anticipation of this trip, I&rsquo;ve used it for some shorter trips earlier in the year as a trial run. So far, I&rsquo;m very happy with this bag. I&rsquo;ll probably continue to use it when I need something that doesn&rsquo;t need to be checked.</p>\n<p>As far as clothing strategy, I wanted to go for a capsule wardrobe where any top can be worn with any bottom. I also chose merino wool t-shirts since I&rsquo;ve read they are good for travel, stay relatively clean (even after wearing for multiple days, but so far I haven&rsquo;t had to test this theory), and dry quickly (in the event you need to wash them in your hotel room).</p>\n<p>My goal was to be able to go 7 days without doing laundry, so I have enough socks, underwear, and shirts to accomplish that.

				"content_text": "\nThere's some interest in how I packed for this trip, so here's a post about that. (Hi, Su!)\n\nI knew I needed to develop a packing strategy ahead of the trip so I could be away for about a month. I also had a few other goals:\n\n* Have a carry-on sized bag so I wouldn't need to check it and it'd more easily be stowed on trains \n* Ideally a backpack so I'm not lugging a roller down cobblestone streets or something like that. Plus it would be nice to have both hands free \n* Enough organization to keep clean and dirty clothes separated. Plus have my bag not turn into a sloppy nightmare after living out of it for a month. Since for a good portion of the trip I'd be in the same spot for only 2 nights, repacking and staying organized should be easy. \n\nSo, in anticipation for this trip, I got a [Cotopaxi Allpa 42L travel pack](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-42l-travel-pack). \n\nWhat appealed to me about this is that it opens suitcase style and has some organization but not too much. So more pockets than a duffle bag, but not excessively compartmentalized. \n\nIt's also a backpack first and includes a hip belt, which has been great and I'd highly recommend a hip belt for a bag this size. \n\n\n![An open suitcase on a bed with neatly organized clothes and a pair of shoes beside it. The suitcase contains various clothing items including shirts and pants, and utilizes packing cubes for organization.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/745b8e68-8fc9-4c51-aa18-f358aa7ea628.jpg)\n\nHere‚Äôs how I‚Äôm organizing the bag:\n\n* Main compartment\n\t* jackets and nicer shirts in the bottom of the main compartment folded simply to not be too thick\n\t* packing cubes on top of those\n\t\t* small packing cube (top): underwear and socks\n\t\t* large packing cube (bottom): pants, shorts, t-shirts\n* Top left small compartment\n\t* packable day bag\n\t* travel towel\n* Bottom left mid-size compartment\n    * Beach stuff (bathing suits, beach shirts)\n    * Extra shoes and sandals\n* small compartment on the face of the bag (which is face down on the bed)\n\t* My dopp kit\n\t* Some small items like power adapters and battery\n\nHere's everything stowed. \n\n![An open travel backpack with clothing items visible through their mesh tops, lying on a textured gray blanket with a yellow patterned sheet underneath.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/97ccd205-3cf9-45f0-a498-8bbb1eab9a64.jpg)\n\nAnd here's the bag all zipped up. \n\n![A blue travel backpack with a silhouette of an alpaca on it, placed on a gray knitted blanket over a patterned sheet.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7b09ce09-556d-41dd-b82f-839050851fff.jpg)\n\nPacked like this it weighs 24.6 lbs.\n\nWhile I got this bag in anticipation of this trip, I've used it for some shorter trips earlier in the year as a trial run. So far, I'm very happy with this bag. I'll probably continue to use it when I need something that doesn't need to be checked. \n\nAs far as clothing strategy, I wanted to go for a capsule wardrobe where any top can be worn with any bottom. I also chose merino wool t-shirts since I've read they are good for travel, stay relatively clean (even after wearing for multiple days, but so far I haven't had to test this theory), and dry quickly (in the event you need to wash them in your hotel room). \n\nMy goal was to be able to go 7 days without doing laundry, so I have enough socks, underwear, and shirts to accomplish that. Ideally I'd be able use hotel laundry service before I hit 7 days and I could avoid doing laundry in my room. So far, so good on this front. I've used a coin-op laundry once and have my hotel doing laundry today. \n\nSo one challenge for my trip in particular, aside from the length, is the different climates I'd be traveling through. From moderate, damp climates like London, cold mountain climates of Switzerland, and warm beach climates of Italy. \n\nHere's a tally of what I packed in more detail:\n* 2x button up long sleeve shirts\n* 1x button up short sleeve shirt\n* 2x cotton t-shirts\n* 5x merino short sleeve t-shirts\n* 1x merino long sleeve shirt\n* 1x exercise/hike shirt\n* 1x lounge shorts\n* 2x synthetic shorts\n* 1x synthetic pants (wore the second pair on the plane)\n* 7x pairs of socks (5x merino, 2x cotton)\n* 7x underware\n* Rain jacket\n* Arcterix packable down jacket\n* 2x hats\n* 2x swim suits\n* 2x beach shirts\n* Sandals\n* Extra sneakers (Lems)\n* packable backpack (Matador)\n* packable travel towel\n\nReading this list out, I think I fit a lot in the bag without it feeling extremely over packed. (It does require some effort to close, though.)\n\nOne thing I didn't want to put in the Allpa was any electronics or things (like medicine) I'd want with me in the event my backpack was checked. \n\nFor this, I opted for this [sling bag from Aer](https://aersf.com/products/day-sling-3-x-pac). In here I packed:\n* iPad 10\" Air\n* Kobo ebook reader\n* Medicine \n* International power adapters\n* Phone/iPad charger and cords\n* Passport\n* Print out of train tickets\n* Glasses and sunglasses \n\nThis bag is just big enough to fit all the above!\n\nSo, about a week and a half in to the trip and so far I'm pretty satisfied with this setup! I think this has convinced me that carry-on backpack travel is the way to go!\n\nHave you ever packed for a trip like this? How did you pack and how did it go? Let me know in the comments!\n\nUpdate: I forgot to mention some clothing I purchased during my trip:\n* A lightweight zip up fleece from North Face. I wanted another layer in Zermatt before going up to 12,000 feet and something that was more mid-weight than my down jacket. \n* A crushable Mont Bell hat.

I did see the border/customs while exiting the platform, but they weren't stopping anyone to check passports or scan bags. \n\nI had about an hour here, which was more than enough time to have lunch and coffee and do a small bit of sightseeing just outside the station. \n\n![Indoor corridor in a modern building with people walking, shops on the right, decorative wood paneling on the ceiling, glass facade on the left, and hanging clocks.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c37f7c01-ccb9-497c-b53c-ade6a7b4bfaa.jpg)\n\nGotta love the bike parking!\n\n![Red double-decker bus parked beside a crowded bicycle rack, with apartment buildings in the background and street art on a building wall.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a0ff683a-9e72-4f60-8d19-ad5ec0b3d8cd.jpg)\n\nNext was a Swiss regional train headed to Brig, but I'd be transferring at Visp.\n\n![A red and white train at a station platform with overhead electrical lines and a blue commuter train visible in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/f64bc6f9-3cbf-411a-b680-c6fe73d96fdc.jpg)\n\nAnother first class cabin. Nothing too special, but totally comfortable. \n\n![Interior of a modern train carriage with red and grey upholstery, overhead storage, and large windows. A television screen shows an advertisement. Passengers are by the door, and a worker is visible through the window.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/dd1aff60-eb51-4ab7-9e76-a5f54f393feb.jpg)\n\nAs we rose further into the Alps, the landscapes became more dramatic. There's some very beautiful looking towns on the way from Geneva to Visp. Looking at the map, I realized I'm following the Rh√¥ne river all the way from Lyon to Visp. The river valley in the Alps makes for some great scenery.\n\n![A scenic view of agricultural fields under a cloudy sky, with raindrops visible on the surface from which the photo is taken, suggesting it was shot through a window.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/a315ecf3-0d98-40f9-8393-695a1aaca397.jpg)\n\n![A verdant landscape with a solitary house, lush green fields, and a backdrop of towering, mist-shrouded mountains, partially obscured by power lines in the foreground.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/3d4fca23-1aec-49e1-ac0c-ea375cf818e0.jpg)\n\n![A scenic landscape featuring a lush green field, possibly a vineyard, with rows of plants leading towards a mountain range in the background.

I have no idea if my train uses these, but interesting to see nonetheless. \n\n![View from a train window showing train tracks with cogs and lush green trees in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/15bca72a-3184-40a2-bf58-9f5d5987e7dc.jpg)\n\nIn about an hour, I've arrived in Zermatt and, wow, is it beautiful! It's a million chalets, sporting shops, a river, and mountains. Zermatt is essentially car free. Tourists must park in one town lower in the valley and take the train up. \n\n![Tourists with luggage walking down a street lined with Swiss chalet-style buildings and shops, including a Rolex store, with mountains in the background.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/5b65888a-d22b-451f-b072-263caddf0d43.jpg)\n\nAt 5,276 ft (1,608 m) of elevation, we are certainly up in the mountains!\n\n![A tennis court in a mountainous region with players on the court, surrounded by buildings and trees, with snow-capped mountains in the background and various international flags displayed.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/440eb9ce-b308-4a7e-b69e-89bf9f75a85f.jpg)\n\nJust steps from where I'm staying.\n\n![A river flowing through a channel in a mountain town with buildings on either side and snow-capped mountains in the background under a cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/cf63b3df-ca8f-4764-a68d-92be110dadeb.jpg)\n\nThe view from the small balcony on my room, incredible!\n\n![Alpine village with chalet-style buildings nestled between green mountain slopes under a cloudy sky.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7ffb81b1-9b27-4cf7-9078-18ac1fbdd2ba.jpg)\n\nThat's all from me today. I'm hoping to have an early dinner and an early night so I can clock a full 8 hours. Tomorrow, I've booked a gondola to take me up to one of the highest gondola accessible points in Europe. There should be views of the Matterhorn and many other peaks. \n\nGoodnight!\n",

Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve fulfilled the goal of riding the high speed line that caught my attention as a child!</p>\n<p>What was exciting, new, and futuristic around 40 years ago now just seems ordinary here. The train lives up to its high speed lineage. The cars themselves were nothing special, I&rsquo;d say.  Double decker, luggage racks, bathrooms, a mix of seats with tables and without. Roughly similar to what I&rsquo;m familiar with in the northeast of the US. Definitely comfortable and roomy compared to a plane. But Eurostar is taking the cake in terms of fit and finish and service. Of course, I chose this leg based on schedule and speed. I could have taken an earlier or later train that had more amenities. But honestly, it&rsquo;s such a short trip I didn&rsquo;t really miss them.</p>\n<p>Plus, the scenery passing by was beautiful. It felt like an animated Windows XP wallpaper, only better looking.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c28edaaf-c8ae-43d4-beb6-9f761bf6c817.jpg\" alt=\"A lush green field under a partly cloudy sky, with a utility pole bearing signs in the foreground, and distant buildings on the horizon.\"></p>\n<p>Pretty quickly we were pulling in to Lyon.

Nonetheless, I've fulfilled the goal of riding the high speed line that caught my attention as a child! \n\nWhat was exciting, new, and futuristic around 40 years ago now just seems ordinary here. The train lives up to its high speed lineage. The cars themselves were nothing special, I'd say.  Double decker, luggage racks, bathrooms, a mix of seats with tables and without. Roughly similar to what I'm familiar with in the northeast of the US. Definitely comfortable and roomy compared to a plane. But Eurostar is taking the cake in terms of fit and finish and service. Of course, I chose this leg based on schedule and speed. I could have taken an earlier or later train that had more amenities. But honestly, it's such a short trip I didn't really miss them.\n\nPlus, the scenery passing by was beautiful. It felt like an animated Windows XP wallpaper, only better looking. \n\n![A lush green field under a partly cloudy sky, with a utility pole bearing signs in the foreground, and distant buildings on the horizon.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/c28edaaf-c8ae-43d4-beb6-9f761bf6c817.jpg)\n\nPretty quickly we were pulling in to Lyon. My train went on to other stops beyond this, so it was only in the station for a few minutes. This particular route stopped at the station near the Lyon airport. And wow, I really loved the architecture of the station.\n\n![A double-decker train branded \"OUIGO\" at a modern station with an arched concrete canopy and clear skies.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/b78f81fa-c58a-4ac5-8299-b900f1275ba0.jpg)\n\n![An interior view of a modern train station with distinctive architectural rib-like structures supporting the ceiling, leading to a central area with natural light streaming in.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/7aca83c3-0af2-4dc4-9de4-f70883468bae.jpg)\n\nBecause I was at the airport, I needed to take light rail into the city center. \n\n![View from inside a train with a window sticker reminding passengers to collect their luggage, featuring the logo \"Vigipirate,\" the French national security alert system. Beyond the window are train tracks, green fields, and a blue sky with clouds.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/70ff668a-e766-4856-abb4-ea5a55a69aae.jpg)\n\nAfter this, I took a street tram further into the city toward my hotel. A short walk later and I'm at my hotel. I'm staying at Hotel Globe et Cecil which is charming and centrally located. \n\n![A wide river flanked by embankments with walking paths, trees, and buildings under a clear sky with scattered clouds. A distinctive building with a dome is on the left.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/ed61cb66-bedb-4185-a1a4-877a66a415e5.jpg)\n\n\nBecause of the length of my trip and the limited packing space I have (if you have interest in how I packed for this trip, let me know and I can post about it!), I needed to get some laundry done. I thought my hotel had laundry service, but turns out they do, just not on weekends. So I decided to try a coin op. Can you believe this is my walk to the laundromat, which is in Vieux Lyon (the old city):\n\n![A narrow city street lined with a mix of modern and traditional buildings, featuring cobblestone pavement with rectangular bollards, under a partly cloudy sky. A single person is walking down the sidewalk in the distance.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/0daa2825-3bca-48c1-bd07-2289da2adc40.jpg)\n\n![A river flows through an urban landscape with a bridge crossing over, and a boat on the water.

I had a boudin noir and apple pie which I really enjoyed. Dessert was a dish called √Æle flottante which means floating island. I needed to look this one up before ordering, I've never heard of the dish in English or French. It's a block of meringue floating in a pool of cr√®me anglaise. It's really great! \n\n![A slice of meringue in a pool of custard with caramel sauce and powdered sugar on a black plate with a spoon, on a wooden table.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/bb98cfd4-5105-4143-842b-8e0760911432.jpg)\n\nAfter dinner, I walked a little out of the way around Vieux Lyon to take in the scenery at night.\n\n![A narrow cobblestone street lined with old buildings and illuminated by street lamps at twilight, signs for businesses hang on walls, and a few people are visible in the distance.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/77ae4db9-b2f8-4d6d-940e-edaf942e00f9.jpg)\n\n![A clock shop window display at night featuring a large overhead wall clock with the brand \"CRIVET\" and \"LYON 1852\" and various clock mechanisms and artistic objects inside.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1726/2024/71427239-f7b3-4e81-8984-b4e0cde21ebb.jpg)\n\nTomorrow, another day in Lyon.

I can't wait!\n\nThe Glacier Express terminates in St. Moritz where I'll take the Bernina Express to finish my pass through the Alps and transit into Italy via Tirano. Two nights in Milan is followed by Italian high speed rail down to Rome, where I'll link up with my wife.\n\nThere's a lot of firsts for me in this trip: every country on the itinerary, high speed rail, and an extended solo journey. I've traveled solo for work and conferences in the past, but never on vacation. So, this will be a true adventure for me. I'm mostly excited, but also a little anxious. \n\nIn Rome, I'll meet up with my wife, who's traveling separately after a trip with her sister. From there, we'll spend the next two weeks together traveling in Italy. In addition to Rome, we have Florence, Tuscany, and Puglia (via Bari) on our Italian itinerary. \n\nIf you'd like to follow along with my journey, I plan to post updates as I go right here on this site. If email is your thing, I've turned on this site's newsletter feature ([subscribe here](https://doug.pub/subscribe/)) so you can these posts right in your inbox.\n\nThe journey begins this week on May 20 when I take the overnight flight from Atlanta to London. Thanks for reading! Next update from London!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/01/04/southwest-airlines-and-technical-debt/\">Michael Tsai on Southwest Airlines and Technical Debt</a></p>\n<p>This is a really interesting take on how technical debt directly contributed to Southwest&rsquo;s terrible week.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/southwest-airlines-computers.html\">Zeynep Tufekci&rsquo;s article on the NYT</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It‚Äôs been an open secret within Southwest for some time, and a shameful one, that the company desperately needed to modernize its scheduling systems. Software shortcomings contributed to previous, smaller-scale meltdowns, and Southwest unions had repeatedly warned about the software. Without more government regulation and oversight and greater accountability, we may see more fiascos like this one, which most likely stranded hundreds of thousands of Southwest passengers ‚Äî perhaps more than a million ‚Äî over Christmas week. And not just for a single company, as the problem is widespread across many industries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This problem ‚Äî relying on older or deficient software that needs updating ‚Äî is known as incurring technical debt, meaning there is a gap between what the software needs to be and what it is. While aging code is a common cause of technical debt in older companies ‚Äî such as with airlines, which started automating early ‚Äî it can also be found in newer systems, because software can be written in a rapid and shoddy way, rather than in a more resilient manner that makes it more dependable and easier to fix or expand. As you might expect, quicker is cheaper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think what&rsquo;s so insiduous about technical debt is there&rsquo;s not always an obvious, clear measurement that you&rsquo;ve taken on too much. Every software system has some amount of technical debt, but it&rsquo;s a challenge, even for experienced software engineers, to guage the level of debt. It&rsquo;s not equivalent to the physical world where you can see if something is crumbling or has some other type of defect.</p>\n<p>In some cases, software&rsquo;s technical debt may be obvious, for example if its running on hardware or software that is no longer available or updated by it&rsquo;s developers.

				"content_text": "[Michael Tsai on Southwest Airlines and Technical Debt](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/01/04/southwest-airlines-and-technical-debt/)\n\nThis is a really interesting take on how technical debt directly contributed to Southwest's terrible week. \n\nFrom [Zeynep Tufekci's article on the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/southwest-airlines-computers.html):\n\n> It‚Äôs been an open secret within Southwest for some time, and a shameful one, that the company desperately needed to modernize its scheduling systems. Software shortcomings contributed to previous, smaller-scale meltdowns, and Southwest unions had repeatedly warned about the software. Without more government regulation and oversight and greater accountability, we may see more fiascos like this one, which most likely stranded hundreds of thousands of Southwest passengers ‚Äî perhaps more than a million ‚Äî over Christmas week. And not just for a single company, as the problem is widespread across many industries.\n\n> This problem ‚Äî relying on older or deficient software that needs updating ‚Äî is known as incurring technical debt, meaning there is a gap between what the software needs to be and what it is. While aging code is a common cause of technical debt in older companies ‚Äî such as with airlines, which started automating early ‚Äî it can also be found in newer systems, because software can be written in a rapid and shoddy way, rather than in a more resilient manner that makes it more dependable and easier to fix or expand. As you might expect, quicker is cheaper.\n\nI think what's so insiduous about technical debt is there's not always an obvious, clear measurement that you've taken on too much. Every software system has some amount of technical debt, but it's a challenge, even for experienced software engineers, to guage the level of debt. It's not equivalent to the physical world where you can see if something is crumbling or has some other type of defect. \n\nIn some cases, software's technical debt may be obvious, for example if its running on hardware or software that is no longer available or updated by it's developers. COBOL running on a mainframe is a good example. \n\nHowever, as Tufekci's article states, even newer software can suffer from technical debt. On the contrary, it is possible for old software to be well maintained and have an acceptable amount of technical debt. For example, many modern operating systems (such as Linux) are decades old yet remain well maintained and cutting edge. \n\nIt's likely that Southwest runs on programming languages and operating systems that are actively updated, but the debt lies in the software that they've written and runs their business. This is probably the case that a lot of companies in the 10-20 year old range fall into, and they would not be unique if they had technical debt that has gone out of control. \n\nIt's an industry problem. We lack the tools and techniques to appropriately guage tech debt in quantifiable ways. How much technical debt is too much and how much impact it may have on a business boils down to opinion. Different engineers will debate with each other on this topic. There's no standard, industry bechmarks or regulations to turn to, unlike other fields of engineering. \n\nPerhaps our field will develop such standards, but my hunch is that software is unique enough from other engineering disciplines that we may never be able to develop such standards. I'd like to be wrong about this.\n\nDoes anyone know of productive cases of measuring tech debt? Or systemic ways to keep it within a maintainable limit?\n\n",
